// Tests/AetherEngineTests/BridgedAudioOriginTests.swift
// AE#561 follow-up: `baseMediaDecodeTime` is `unsigned int(64)`, so a negative published timestamp
// is not merely unusual, it is unrepresentable. The audio bridge stamps the FRAME it hands the
// encoder, and an encoder declaring `initial_padding` stamps its first PACKET a padding below that
// frame (256 samples on the AC-3 family, 0 on FLAC). At source position 0 that published -256 as
// 2^64 - 256, and AVPlayer placed the first audio fragment 584 thousand years out, losing its audio.
// Nothing discards the priming here, because the muxer writes no edit list on purpose, so the
// counter carries the padding and the content pays its 5.3 ms instead.
