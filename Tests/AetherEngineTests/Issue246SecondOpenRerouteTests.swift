/// AE#246: the load-time probe can fail for a transient reason that is not the HLS classification,
/// so `probeFailure` is inconclusive and the AE#154 reroute does not fire. The load then falls
/// through to the loopback path with a nil preopened demuxer, and `HLSVideoEngine.start()` reopens
/// the same URL. That second open is the first one to read the playlist body, so it is the one that
/// produces `AVIOReaderError.hlsPlaylistOnVODPath`.
///
/// Interpolating that typed error into `HLSVideoEngineError.openFailed(reason:)` erased the domain,
/// and a reroutable source died as a terminal `openFailed`. These cover the pure pieces: the open
/// failure mapping, and the reroute decision on the error the mapping now preserves.
