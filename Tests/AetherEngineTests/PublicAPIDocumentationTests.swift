/// The documentation gap that produced this test: the README's API tour enumerated the engine's
/// `@Published` properties and named neither `PassthroughSubject`, so a shipping downstream host read
/// the whole tour and came away without the live-retune contract (#374). It had no compile error to
/// find it with, because a subject nobody subscribes to is silent by construction. The same shape
/// hides every surface that requires a host ACTION rather than a host read.
///
/// So the rule is mechanical: a public surface a host consumes has to be NAMED somewhere in the
/// documentation. Naming is a low bar on purpose. This test cannot judge whether a paragraph is any
/// good, only whether one exists at all, and the failure it prevents is the silent one: a symbol
/// shipping with no prose anywhere, discovered by an adopter instead of by us.
///
/// Three surfaces are checked, and they are the three where a missing mention costs an adopter:
/// every public member of `AetherEngine` itself, every public type in the host-facing files, and
/// every `LoadOptions` field. Fields of value types are deliberately not required: a host that has
/// the type has its members from autocomplete, which is not true of an engine method nobody
/// mentioned or an option nobody listed.
