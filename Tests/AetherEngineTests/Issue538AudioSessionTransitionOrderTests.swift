/// AE#538 moved the renderer activation off the main actor, next to the #215 release that already ran
/// there. While the activation was synchronous on the main actor a `stop()` could not land inside it, so
/// the release always came after it. Two detached tasks have no such order: a stop during a software or
/// audio-only load's activation could send `setActive(false)` first and leave the session active after a
/// final teardown, which is the passthrough ring #215 exists to close. Both now go through one queue.
/// The session itself cannot be driven on macOS, so these tests lock the queue the two calls share.
