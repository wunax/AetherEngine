/// Audit LIF-101: the CORE-2 owed background decision settled on any move out of `.loading`, and a
/// native load passes through `.paused` (the item's readiness, landing inside the tvOS play gate)
/// seconds before it returns. The tvOS teardown that followed bumped the generation under the load,
/// and the host's `load()` threw the `CancellationError` that means "a newer load or stop took
/// over". Sodalite reads it exactly that way: no observers, no start report, a spinner forever.
///
/// The lifecycle itself is iOS / tvOS only; the owed funnel is not, so these drive it through
/// `noteDidEnterBackground()` and a policy seam that performs the same synchronous teardown.
// Serialized: each test parks a load's reader on a cooperative-pool thread until the test releases
// it, and the release itself needs a pool thread. Run in parallel, these filled CI's four-thread
// pool and stalled the whole swift-testing process for about 100 s.
