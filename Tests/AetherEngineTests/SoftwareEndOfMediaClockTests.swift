/// AE#374: how long the software clock may keep running after the producer is done.
///
/// The defect this policy closes is not a crash: the synchronizer kept its rate past end of media, so
/// `currentTime` walked past `duration` (measured: 20.13 s published on a 12.0 s source) and the 1 Hz
/// `[SWDiag]` line reported an `aLead` falling at exactly 1.00 per second on a session that had simply
/// finished. Both halves read as a live defect to anyone holding the log.
