// A sequential origin advertises its segments from the VIDEO cut ledger: a segment's EXTINF is the
// distance between two keyframe-gated opens, and a plan index no keyframe opened is a zero-duration
// hole with no URI. Audio used to be routed by time against the plan instead, so on a source whose
// GOP is longer than the 4 s stride it opened that hole on its own, the video after it went into a
// file the playlist never listed, and AVPlayer stalled at the end of seg0 (a remote MKV with an
// 11.3 s first GOP lost 4 to 11 s). The same hole arrived before seg0's capture had, and the report
// funnel anchored on it, so every later report was refused as out of order and the playlist stayed
// empty. Both are witnessed here by counting what the finished playlist actually carries.
