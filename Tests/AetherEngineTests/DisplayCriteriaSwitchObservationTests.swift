// #339: the mode-switch observers used to be registered when the play gate opened. The engine's own criteria
// write happens in the pre-flight, before the item is built, so a switch could start and finish outside that
// window: both notifications were lost and the gate was left inferring from `isDisplayModeSwitchInProgress`.
// Two of the three device runs in Sodalite#49 spent the whole Stage 2 cap that way, waiting for an end that
// had already happened.
//
// The observation is now armed at the write and the gate reads what it recorded. That verdict is a pure
// function of four values, and the two asymmetries in it are the load-bearing part: an end alone must never
// settle the gate (it can belong to an older switch, e.g. the criteria reset a sole-writer load performs),
// and the in-progress flag may only veto a settle, never confirm one.
