/// container-declared ratio never lands: Matroska writes its DisplayWidth quotient to
/// `st->sample_aspect_ratio` (matroskadec.c), MP4 does the same with `pasp` (mov.c), and codecpar
/// stays 0:1. The fallback was therefore dead in exactly the case it was written for, while
/// MPEG-2 sources kept working because their ratio arrives per frame from the sequence header.

/// Found while verifying #290 against a VP9 MKV declaring its SAR in the container: the engine
