/// #362, second mechanism: a hole in the harvest, read as a silence in the source.
///
/// After a seek the pump restarts behind the landing and fills forward, while the store still holds
/// an island the previous run harvested further ahead. The drain window then reads as "packets,
/// hole, packets", and decoding straight across it carries the cursor to the far side. The cursor
/// only ever moves forward, so the hole's packets, which land a second later, are never read: a
/// stretch of the film has no subtitles at all, and the set before the hole is closed at the island
/// instead of at its own clear (report: eleven authored sets delivered as two).
///
/// The gap's SIZE cannot tell a hole from an authored silence, and a threshold on it does real
/// damage: a PGS set is separated from its own clear by its display duration, so a 3 s rule stopped
/// the tick at every authored line and delivery fell to a sixth of the sets in a fixture run.
/// Harvest ORDER tells them apart, because a run reads forwards: within one run PTS and sequence
/// rise together, and a PTS-ascending pair whose sequence descends is two runs meeting over a span
/// neither has read.
