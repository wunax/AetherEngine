// #369: the advance park's release is a consumer fetch of `target`, but a sequential append
// playlist advertises only what the pump's own finalize reports have fed it. A target beyond
// that frontier is a self-deadlock (field: fold-to-tail parked at target=364 while the playlist
// ended at seg61, freezing it for good); a negative target releases instantly and is none.
