/// Audit DMX-102 / DMX-109 / DMX-112: `Demuxer.markClosed()` is the one lock-free abort a teardown
/// has, and it only reached the stages that already had a provider to mark. The provider was
/// published after `provider.open()` returned, so a close during the connect (up to 15 s on a live
/// source) found nothing; a local-path source had no provider at all, so the interrupt callback
/// installed on it never saw the close; and a pump parked for an origin slot ignored it.
///
/// The bounds below are the assertions: every abort is measured against a wait the defect would
/// have sat out in full (10 s of withheld first byte, 10 s of slot wait).
