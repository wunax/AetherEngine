/// #220 (rrgomes): the #151 prefetcher memoized its own time-base lookup failure. A nil
/// `stream(at:)` fell back to `0/1`, that value went into the cache for the session, and the
/// park guard (`tb.num > 0`) then skipped every subsequent packet on the stream, so the reader
/// ran the rest of the session with no forward park: exactly the "reads straight past dozens of
/// parkable packets" shape seen on the wire, from a single transient lookup and with no
/// allocator pathology needed. The same value also reached the packet store, where the harvest
/// rate is `num/den` and a zero rate lands every cue at second 0.
