/// AE#491 round 2: the generation is bumped when a seek is REQUESTED, and the read position moves
/// when the reposition RUNS, tens of milliseconds later. Round 1 gated everything on that
/// generation, which closes the door on a packet read before the bump and leaves it open for one
/// read INSIDE the window: those bytes are from the position the seek left behind and carry the new
/// generation, so every gate passes them.
///
/// Measured on the 6.68.2 build with a 3000 s fixture and a chain of large alternating seeks two
/// seconds apart: 5 to 9 packets per twelve-seek run entered the pipeline from a source that had not
/// been repositioned yet, with timestamps at the OLD position, and two of three runs paused the
/// clock for a rebuffer that was not happening. Same runs on this fix: zero, and none.
