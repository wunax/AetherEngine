/// AE#448: after a seek whose restart opened a fresh epoch, the reported clock sat about 1.7 s ABOVE
/// the frame on screen for seven seconds and then settled on its own.
///
/// The axis was right the whole time. What was missing was a SEAM. An epoch whose first segment opens
/// exactly on its boundary carries no offset, so nothing was recorded for it and nothing was published,
/// and the stretch it had just taken over kept folding with whatever seam sat below it. After a
/// backward seek that seam belongs to an older epoch, and the difference between the two is the error.
///
/// Measured on `tc-cues-lie.mkv` with `play --picture-probe`, resume at 53 s and seeks to 25 and 3:
///
/// ```
/// #418 seg13 placed (advertised 52.000s, worth -9.000s): axis  0.000 ->  -9.000  seamAt=52.000
/// #418 seg3  placed (advertised 12.000s, worth -1.667s): axis -9.000 -> -10.667  seamAt=21.000
/// video gate open: actual=0 desired=0 shift=0                      <- worth nothing, published nothing
/// t=25 cur=5.50  pic=3.875  picItem=14.584  axisErr=-10.709  capErr=-1.625
/// t=31 cur=11.60 pic=9.875  picItem=20.584  axisErr=-10.709  capErr=-1.725
/// t=32 cur=10.93 pic=10.875 picItem=21.584  axisErr=-10.709  capErr=-0.058   <- crossed item 21.000
/// memprobe: prodShift=-10.67s hostShift=-9.00s seams=2
/// ```
///
/// `prodShift` against `hostShift` names it exactly: the session's axis was `-10.667` and the clock
/// folded `-9.000`, because the playhead sat below the newest seam at 21.000 and the map answered
/// from the one under it. It healed by itself the moment playback crossed 21.000, which is why this
/// reads as a settle rather than as a wrong axis.
