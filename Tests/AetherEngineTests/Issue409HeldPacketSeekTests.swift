/// still open: once the verdict had landed (a healthy file decides `.off` on its first packet, with the
/// sample still held), the queue outlived the seek and `dequeue()` handed the abandoned position's packets
/// out ahead of the landing's. On the producer path that put duplicate pictures into a stream it had
/// already emitted, which `Issue259A53CaptionAxisTests` sees as two repeated A/53 observations.
