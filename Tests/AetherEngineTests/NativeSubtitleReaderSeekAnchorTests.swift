/// The other half of #234, found while fixing it and not a regression: `runNativeSubtitleReaders`
/// has the same unanchored positioning seek, for a different reason.
///
/// The forward prefetcher sets its discard flags and then seeks, so before #230 the subtitle stream
/// was the sole survivor of `av_find_default_stream_index`'s +200 for `discard != AVDISCARD_ALL`
/// and anchored the seek by accident. The native readers seek first and set discard afterwards, so
/// at seek time every stream is still `AVDISCARD_DEFAULT`, every stream scores the +200, and video
/// wins on its own +75. That has been true since the readers were written: there was never an
/// accident to lose.
///
/// The consequence is the same as #234's. On Matroska the seek lands in the cluster holding the
/// last video keyframe, so a cue that starts further back is behind the read head before the first
/// packet arrives and the destination stays uncovered until the next cue. The readers feed the
/// native WebVTT renditions, so what goes missing there is the line that should be on screen when a
/// seek lands.
///
/// Both readers are meant to share every positioning fix, so this pins the same anchor down here.
/// Fixture and shape are #234's: landing at 3 s running to 11 s, successor at 12 s, seek to 7.5 s.
