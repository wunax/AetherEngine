/// #489: `AetherEngine.videoGravity` reached the software display layer only through its setter.
/// A host built during a load came up on the layer's own default, so a value the host app set
/// before playback started was dropped, and the same value set again mid-session worked. The
/// native path has always re-applied the stored gravity on every host build
/// (`AetherEngine+Loading.swift`); the software path now does too, at construction, so the layer
/// is never briefly on a gravity nobody asked for.
///
/// A host app drawing its own subtitle overlay has to know which gravity is on screen to place
/// cues against the right rectangle, and it can only learn that from the engine.
