/// AE#418 (rrgomes): after a restart whose gate re-aimed below its boundary, the clock ran ahead of
/// the picture by the re-aim. Captions about four seconds early on a resume that re-aimed 3.045 s,
/// about eight after restarts that re-aimed 3.1 and 5.0, and a synced host reports the wrong position
/// with them. Lip sync survives, because audio and video sit in the same segment.
///
/// **AVPlayer presents a segment at the position the PLAYLIST gives it, not at the tfdt it carries.**
/// AE#408 shipped the early-opening gate on the opposite assumption and published no offset for that
/// case. `aetherctl play --picture-probe` measures it directly, on a fixture whose picture states its
/// own source time in binary.
///
/// Round 1 (6.43.0) got the offset right and its LIFETIME wrong. It keyed the offset to "the decode
/// run AVPlayer began here" and answered that from the fetch order, treating any request that did not
/// follow its predecessor as a fresh run. The reporter's seek burst falsified it: a fetch out of
/// sequence happens while AVPlayer stays inside the run it is already playing, and the axis was then
/// republished from under a picture that had not moved, which is the pre-fix shape re-entered.
///
/// Round 2 measures what the offset actually does, at re-aims of 0.5, 0.875, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 s:
///
/// - It **composes**. AVPlayer places a segment at its advertised start read through the mapping its
///   timeline ALREADY carries, so re-placing an overlong segment adds its offset again. A resume that
///   opened 9 s below its boundary reads `axisErr=-9.000`; a seek that makes AVPlayer fetch that same
///   segment a second time reads `-18.000`, and one that provokes a restart re-aiming 5 s more reads
///   `-14.000`. Round 1 published `0.000` for all three.
/// - It survives a seek unchanged, which is what the reporter's case turns on, **unless it is under a
///   second**: `-0.500` and `-0.875` read `axisErr=0.000` after a seek, `-1.000` and everything above
///   it survive one. AVPlayer discards a sub-second axis and snaps back to the playlist.
///
/// Measured on `tc-cues-lie.mkv` (Cues injected at non-sync positions, 12 s keyframe drought at 43 s),
