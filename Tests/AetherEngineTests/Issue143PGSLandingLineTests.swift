/// #143 (cmcpherson274): a seek landing mid-cue (or exactly on a display-set start boundary) on a
/// PGS stream WITHOUT acquisition points never re-showed the landing line, forced cues included,
/// until the next authored composition arrived. On sparse dialogue the blackout ran tens of seconds.
///
/// Root cause: the reconstruction pass seeded its active-line candidate only from a self-contained
/// composition (Acquisition Point / Epoch Start). On AP-less/sparse-authored streams every lead-in
/// composition is Normal, so no candidate was ever seeded and the landing-span line was silently
/// discarded; the pass-ending composition (the NEXT line) published fine, which is why "first new
/// cue after seek" instruments looked clean.
///
/// The fix seeds the candidate from ANY successfully decoded composition behind the playhead. A
/// composition that decodes at all is renderable by definition (a fresh drain decoder has no stale
/// state; a state-dependent set with missing references fails decode and never reaches the gate),
/// and the steady-state path outside reconstruction already publishes Normal compositions without a
/// self-contained check. Companion fix: every PGS composition and clear broadcasts its start as
/// `pgsTrimAt`; that trim now also closes the candidate's open window, so a line authored to be
/// gone by the playhead (a clear in the lead-in) cannot resurrect at pass end.
