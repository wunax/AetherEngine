/// keyframe drought audio opens boundaries the cutter folded, and those segments carry no
/// random-access point. AVPlayer reaches back a fixed few seconds on a cold seek and does not search
/// for one, so a target below the next sync sample lands late and silently skips content.

/// Measured on a 12 s drought (`Scripts/timecode-fixture.sh` + `Scripts/mkv-cue-fixture.py`, seek from

/// source cut on its real sync samples landed exactly on all three targets tested.
