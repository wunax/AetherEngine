// A URL source that turned out forward-only used to be forced onto the software host, which cannot
// seek on it either and whose picture never reaches an AirPlay receiver (only its audio follows the
// route). When the container states a duration, the engine now serves it as the sequential origin it
// is. The software host itself still cannot hand a receiver its picture, and `airPlayPictureStaysLocal`
// says so instead of letting the TV play sound only in silence.
