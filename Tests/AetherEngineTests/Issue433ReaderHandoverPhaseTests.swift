///
/// The axis is per SESSION, its dedupe gate is per reader INSTANCE, and the two got out of step at the
/// handover: the replacement demuxer is opened first and wired to the sink afterwards, so every delivery
/// `find_stream_info` made went through the gate into a nil sink. The gate then held `.flowing` as its
/// opinion, and the reader that was now serving the session had nothing left to say. The dying reader's
/// `.reconnecting` was the last word anyone heard.
///
/// The rule this pins: a gate deduplicates what a LISTENER has heard, so a listener that just attached has
/// heard nothing, whatever the reader said into the void before it arrived.
