// AE#561: a keyframe-aligned plan's boundaries ARE the container's index entries, and containers
// disagree about what an entry's timestamp means (mov/mp4 sample tables hold decode times, Matroska
// Cues hold presentation times). The cutter gate has to compare a packet on the plan's own axis.
// Fed a decode timestamp against presentation boundaries, no IRAP ever reached its own boundary:
// the gate never opened on it, audio (routed by boundary, ungated) opened the segment instead, and
// every segment began mid-GOP with no random-access point a cold decode could start on. AVPlayer
// answered that with -19602 the first time it had to decode FROM a segment boundary instead of
// through one.
