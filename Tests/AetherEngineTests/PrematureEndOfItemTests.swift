// Premature end-of-item recovery (AetherEngine#287).
//
// When a VOD's selected audio track outruns its video track, AVPlayer ends the item the moment the
// video renderer runs dry, tens of seconds short of the advertised duration. Measured on the
// reporter's shape (video 60.0 s, audio 113.0 s, one loopback fMP4 rendition): `didPlayToEndTime` at
// 60.03 s of a 113.02 s presentation, reproducing identically for a 2 s, an 8 s and a 53 s tail, so
// it is the video exhaustion that triggers it and not the length of the tail. The playlist is not
// the culprit either: its EXTINF sum equals the container duration to the millisecond.
//
// `.ended` is terminal (#63/#164), so forwarding that event as an organic finish makes the tail
// unreachable for the rest of the session. The discriminator is AVPlayer contradicting itself: it
// ended the item well inside a presentation it still reports as SEEKABLE. The loaded range cannot
// serve here (unlike #169): at that instant AVPlayer has already trimmed it back to the exhaustion
// point, so it agrees with the mistake.
//
// These pure cases pin that discriminator and the bounds that keep a futile retry from looping.
