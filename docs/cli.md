# aetherctl

A standalone macOS CLI shipped alongside the library for repro work without going through TestFlight + Apple TV. Most subcommands operate on a media source URL (`file://` or `http(s)://`); `live`, `dvr`, `hlsfixture`, and `hlslive` run against built-in synthetic fixtures.

```bash
swift run aetherctl probe <url>          # dump container + streams + duration, exit
swift run aetherctl serve <url>          # park the engine's loopback HLS-fMP4 server
swift run aetherctl validate <url>       # serve + run mediastreamvalidator, exit
swift run aetherctl segverify <url>      # SW-decode each loopback segment in isolation; report independence (#92)
swift run aetherctl swdecode <url>       # open SoftwareVideoDecoder, decode N packets, report

```

Twenty-one subcommands plus the bare-URL `serve` alias.

## probe

Opens the demuxer, prints the codec / resolution / frame rate of the video track, the audio track list (codec, channels, language, Atmos flag), the subtitle track list, the parsed container metadata (`MediaMetadata`: title / artist / album / albumArtist + embedded cover art presence), then exits. No HLS server is started.

## serve

The original behavior. The CLI prints the loopback URL and parks until Ctrl-C; from another terminal you can:

```bash
curl -i  http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8
curl -o  /tmp/init.mp4   http://127.0.0.1:<port>/init.mp4
mediastreamvalidator http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8
mp4dump --verbosity 1 /tmp/init.mp4
ffprobe -v debug /tmp/seg0.mp4
open 'http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8'   # macOS QuickTime
```

`--no-dv` forces the SDR / HDR10 route even for a Dolby Vision source (compare the two playlists).

`--native-subs <index>` turns on the native WebVTT subtitle renditions (the `LoadOptions.prepareNativeSubtitles` path a full session uses): the engine calls `requestNativeSubtitleTrack()` before `start()`, then `attachAllNativeSubtitleStores()` after start. Every non-bitmap text track is served as a language-tagged `EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=SUBTITLES` rendition (`DEFAULT=NO,AUTOSELECT=NO`) in the master playlist, backed by a per-track `subs_N.m3u8` WebVTT media playlist. (An earlier design muxed `mov_text`/tx3g traks into the fMP4; in-band timed text is not HLS-conformant and AVPlayer rejected it, so the WebVTT rendition replaced it, see [formats.md › Native subtitle renditions](formats.md#native-subtitle-renditions-webvtt-for-pip-airplay-and-external-display).) The `<index>` value is legacy and now ignored, kept only for CLI compatibility: every non-bitmap track is always declared, and actual track selection happens via the host API in a full session, not from this flag. `curl` the `master.m3u8` (or open it in QuickTime) to verify the `SUBTITLES` group + `subs_N.m3u8` endpoints enumerate every language as a legible `AVMediaSelection` group. Omit the flag to reproduce the default behavior (no renditions, output identical to before).

`--throttle-kbps N` is a TEST-ONLY slow-CDN simulation: it caps source-IO delivery to N kbit/s. Set it below the stream bitrate to starve the producer below real-time and provoke AVPlayer rebuffers (for example the #92 open-GOP repro). Also available on `seektest`.

## validate

`serve` plus an inline `xcrun mediastreamvalidator` run against the loopback manifest, with the report printed and the engine torn down on completion.

## swdecode

Opens `SoftwareVideoDecoder` for the source's video stream, feeds up to N packets (default 100, override with `--frames N`), and reports counters plus first-frame metadata (pixel format, dimensions). Tests the SW-pipeline decode path end-to-end without needing a render layer. Useful for legacy codecs (MPEG-4 Part 2, MPEG-2, VC-1) and AV1 / VP9 on platforms where the native AVPlayer path doesn't accept them. Verdict distinguishes three failure modes:

- decoder open failed (FFmpegBuild gate or malformed extradata)
- decoder opened but no frames produced (pixel-format conversion, no IDR in window)
- SW decode end-to-end healthy (if real playback still hangs, the failure is downstream in `SoftwarePlaybackHost` frame-enqueue, display-layer attach, or audio-clock sync)

Backed by the public `AetherEngine.swDecodeProbe(url:maxPackets:options:)` static API returning `SoftwareDecodeProbeResult`. Hosts can use the same probe in their own diagnostic overlays.

## play

Runs a full `load()` + `play()` session exactly like a host app and prints 1 Hz transport telemetry (state, phase, currentTime, sourceTime, buffered frontier, duration). Where `swdecode` proves the decoder, `play` proves the transport: it fails loud on the two silent failure modes of a session that "loads fine" but never actually plays (#107): exit 2 when the clock does not advance, exit 3 when a selected subtitle track produces no cues.

```bash
swift run aetherctl play <url>                                  # VOD load, 30 s telemetry
swift run aetherctl play --seconds 60 <url>                     # longer window
swift run aetherctl play --live --dvr-window 1800 <url>         # live path with a DVR ring
swift run aetherctl play --subs teletext <url>                  # activate the first matching subtitle track, log every cue + trim
swift run aetherctl play --host-calls reloadlive,play,extractor,setrate <url>   # mimic a host's post-load call sequence
swift run aetherctl play --live --dvr-window 1800 --audio-stats <url>           # decoded-PCM continuity + per-second audio lead
```

`--subs <codec-or-lang>` matches against the track's libavcodec name or language and logs every overlay cue and cue trim as it lands. `--host-calls` replays host post-load behavior against the fresh session: `play`, `extractor` (`makeFrameExtractor`), `setrate` (`setRate(1.0)`), `reloadlive` (reload the URL on the live path when the probe flags it live, the AetherPlayer Open URL flow), and `seekback` (rewind 20 s into the DVR window at t=15, return to the live edge at t=30); this is how the pre-arming `setRate` wedge was isolated.

`--audio-stats` installs the engine audio tap and watches the decoded PCM itself: an `AGAP` line for every source-PTS discontinuity > 2 ms between consecutive buffers, and per-second `alead` (last decoded audio PTS minus the synchronizer clock) plus `abufs` (buffers delivered) appended to the telemetry. `alead` is the audio renderer's safety margin: on the SW live path the look-ahead pump holds it near `AudioLookaheadPolicy.targetLeadSeconds`; a collapse toward zero means the source or the feeder cannot keep real time (this is how the #107 audio-chopping report was diagnosed).

## segverify

Fetches `init.mp4` and then each media segment in turn from the loopback server and SW-decodes each segment **in isolation** (a fresh decoder per segment, no carried reference frames), reporting how many are independently decodable. A segment that yields `framesDecoded == 0` is not self-contained: its first sample is not an IRAP, so it depends on a predecessor, which is the open-GOP / B-frame boundary defect (#92). `--from N` / `--count K` bound the range (default 0 / 12), `--no-dv` forces the SDR route, `--dump <dir>` writes each fetched segment for offline inspection. Exit 0 when every tested segment is independent, 2 when any is not. This is the ground-truth verifier the #92 fix was validated against (ffmpeg's `hls` muxer scores every segment independent).

## dovitest

Runs the Dolby Vision Profile 7 to 8.1 converter over every video packet of the source and writes the converted elementary stream (Annex B) to `/tmp/aetherctl-dovitest.hevc`, reporting packets processed, conversions, and failures. Lets you confirm the in-engine `DoviRpuConverter` (libdovi) output matches the `dovi_tool -m 2` ground truth offline, without a DV panel:

```bash
swift run aetherctl dovitest <p7-source>
dovi_tool extract-rpu -i /tmp/aetherctl-dovitest.hevc -o out.rpu
dovi_tool info -i out.rpu -f 0   # expect dovi_profile 8, disable_residual_flag true
```

## pktdump

Opens the demuxer under a selectable open profile, optionally seeks, and dumps raw video packet timing exactly as the demuxer delivers it (before any producer-side dts repair and before muxing): per-packet dts / pts / duration / keyframe flag samples, NOPTS and non-monotonic dts counts, and dts-delta / duration histograms. Also prints the resolved stream fields that `find_stream_info` fills (`avg_frame_rate`, `codecpar.video_delay`).

```bash
swift run aetherctl pktdump --at 660 --count 300 --profile playback      <url>
swift run aetherctl pktdump --at 660 --count 300 --profile restartReopen <url>
```

The profile differential is the diagnostic: a `video_delay=0` plus NOPTS or non-monotonic dts under one profile while the other is clean means that profile's open path cannot reconstruct decode-order dts for B-frame content (the #93 post-recovery judder root cause). Backed by the public `PacketTimingProbe.run(url:seekSeconds:packetCount:profileName:)`.

## extract

Opens a `FrameExtractor` against the source and pulls a still frame. Thumbnail mode (default) snaps to the nearest keyframe and downscales to `--width` (default 320); `--snapshot` decodes frame-accurately at full resolution. `--at <sec>` sets the seek position (default 60.0). The first frame is written to `/tmp/aetherctl-extract-<mode>.png`. `--loops N` repeats the extraction across eight cycling positions, which pairs with `leaks --atExit` to validate the decode-context teardown is clean:

```bash
swift run aetherctl extract --at 612 --snapshot <url>          # frame-accurate still
swift run aetherctl extract --width 480 <url>                  # keyframe thumbnail
leaks --atExit -- .build/debug/aetherctl extract --loops 8 <url>   # leak sweep
```

## audio

Plays a source through the audio-only pipeline (default ten seconds, `--seconds N` to override) and reports which host took it (bare AVPlayer vs the FFmpeg renderer path), exercising the same dispatch a music host sees.

## audiotap

    aetherctl audiotap [--duration S] [--out PATH.wav] [--remote] <url>

Brings up the loopback session headless, decodes the audio tap (#95) as fast as segments are produced, writes mono Float32 48 kHz WAV (default `/tmp/audiotap.wav`), and prints buffer count, PCM seconds, discontinuity count, and the covered `sourceTime` span. A clean run reports exactly one discontinuity (the install itself). `--remote` drives the remote-HLS delivery path instead (direct AVPlayer ingest of an HLS url, no loopback): rendition/variant resolution, segment fetch + decrypt, playhead-follow decode. Verification tool for the PCM audio tap across the stream-copy and bridge audio paths.

## bgaudio

Verifies SW-path background audio (iOS keepalive) headless on macOS, where the `UIApplication` background lifecycle that normally drives it does not exist. Loads a software-routed source through the full engine, plays a foreground baseline, toggles the SW host into background-audio-only (`--fg N` foreground seconds, `--bg N` background seconds; defaults 3 / 6), then returns to foreground. Reports per-tick the audio clock, the SW video-frame count, and the process memory footprint, and a verdict. A healthy run shows the clock advancing through the background phase (audio alive), the video-frame count flat (video dropped), the footprint roughly flat (the loop paces on the audio renderer rather than buffering the rest of the file), and the video-frame count rising again on foreground return (resync at the next keyframe). The flag and counters are exposed through DEBUG-only engine hooks, so this command is unavailable in a Release build. Generate a quick software-path clip with `ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc2 -f lavfi -i sine -c:v libvpx-vp9 -c:a aac -shortest clip.mkv`.

## customio

Wraps a local file in a custom `IOReader` and plays it through `load(source:)`. `--memory` reads via `DataIOReader`, `--forward-only` drops the seek capability, `--audio-only` routes through the audio-only pipeline, and `--reload` / `--switch-audio` / `--select-subs` / `--extract` exercise the optional capabilities (background reload, audio-track switch, embedded subtitles, scrub preview) end-to-end.

## disc-inspect

Walks a local DVD-Video or Blu-ray ISO at the filesystem layer (FFmpeg-free) and reports what `DiscReader.wrap` makes of it: the recognition verdict and the stages it went through (ISO9660 / UDF signatures, BDMV / VIDEO_TS contents, resolved extents), so a disc that fails to play is debuggable instead of surfacing a bare `INVALIDDATA`. It also prints the full selectable-title list with each title's duration and chapter offsets (the same titles + chapters the engine exposes via `discTitles` / `discChapters`). Exit 0 when the image is recognized as playable, else 1. `--dump` adds the verbose UDF volume structure under the `.demux` log.

## dualsubs

Activates two subtitle tracks simultaneously on one source (primary + secondary) and prints both cue lists, exercising the dual / bilingual subtitle path. `--primary <streamIndex> --secondary <streamIndex>` select the tracks; `--seek <seconds>` jumps first so you can confirm both channels re-resolve after a seek.

## live

Runs a live MPEG-TS session against a built-in fixture that serves an endless broadcast by looping a seed `.ts` with rewritten timestamps. Flags simulate the failure modes the live path hardens against: `--drop-after N` (mid-stream connection drop + reconnect), `--discontinuity-at N` (program-boundary PTS / PCR jump), `--realtime` (1x wall-clock pacing), `--preroll N` (backlog seconds the paced fixture bursts before 1x pacing; default 30, `0` models a strict-realtime origin with no backlog), `--fast-zap` (loads with `LoadOptions.liveJoinProfile = .fastZap`; the first serve prefers the full holdback but is bounded after two finalized segments plus a 0.5...2.0 s observed-segment grace), `--dvr-window N` (timeshift), `--measure-rss` (sliding-window retention), `--reload-test` (live rejoin end to end, including the full-backlog replay shape some origins serve on reconnect). `--seed <ts>` overrides the seed clip, `--sw` forces the software live path, `--report-cache-bytes` tracks on-disk DVR footprint, `--serve-only` parks the fixture without attaching an engine (raw `curl` / `ffprobe` inspection), `--rewind-test` runs the DVR rewind-and-return matrix variant, and `--gen-highbitrate-seed` generates a ~22 Mbps 1080p H.264 MPEG-TS seed (for RSS-retention measurement) then exits.

## dvr

Runs the rewind matrix across the native and SW paths (`--path native|sw|both`). `--seconds N` and `--dvr-window N` size the run.

## hlsfixture

Slices a local `.ts` into a sliding live HLS playlist and serves it over loopback, with fault knobs (`--master` indirection, `--discontinuity-at`, `--slow-refresh`, `--drop-segment`, `--encrypted`, `--fmp4`, `--port`, `--segment-seconds`) and a `--self-test` mode that runs `HLSLiveIngestReader` against it end to end.

## seektest

Drives a real AVPlayer (native loopback-HLS path) through a burst of rapid seeks and reports the producer-restart coalescing behavior, the longest "wedge" (state `.playing` but the clock frozen), and final settle accuracy (AetherEngine#35). A concurrent sampler probe also checks the seek clock-bounce / `isSeeking` signal (AetherEngine#37 / #38): a single backward seek must not bounce the clock back through the pre-seek position, and `isSeeking` must span the real landing. `--seeks N`, `--gap-ms N`, `--settle N` shape the burst; needs `> 30 s` of seekable VOD. `--throttle-kbps N` caps source-IO delivery to simulate a slow CDN and force rebuffers during the burst (see `serve`).

## hlslive

Replays a synthetic SSAI ad-pod feed through the live-direct-play path to repro the FAST-channel ad-break handling (program-switch detection, muxer rotation with versioned `#EXT-X-MAP`, audio re-anchor, no-cut watchdog). `--segments a.ts,b.ts,c.ts` is required: a comma-separated list of real `.ts` segment files served in order (content / ad / content) without timestamp rewriting. `--seconds N` (default 40) and `--segment-seconds N` (default 5) size the run; `--disc i,j` marks which segment indices carry a leading `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` (default: auto-detected on every file change).

## smbtest

Connects to an SMB2/3 share with `SMBConnection` (SMBClient backend), wraps the file in `SMBIOReader`, and runs a sequential-throughput pass plus a random-seek consistency check. macOS-only; needs the optional `AetherEngineSMB` product (`swift build --product aetherctl` pulls it in). Validates the SMB byte source without a device:

```bash
swift run aetherctl smbtest "smb://user:pass@host/share/path/to/file.mkv" --reads 128
```

`--reads N` sets the random-seek count (default 64). Credentials default to guest when omitted from the URL; URL-encode special characters in the password.

## Fixtures

For repeatable runs, `Scripts/fetch-fixtures.sh` generates a small set of synthetic FFmpeg test clips in `./Fixtures/` (H.264 SDR, HEVC HDR10, AV1, VP9) covering both the native AVPlayer path and the software fallback. Real-world DV / Atmos / multichannel sources go in `./Fixtures/user/` (gitignored).
