/// The transport is [kishikawakatsumi/SMBClient](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/SMBClient):
/// a pure-Swift SMB2 client that speaks the wire protocol over `NWConnection`
/// (Network.framework). This replaces the previous AMSMB2/libsmb2 backend, which
/// failed with POSIX `EPERM` ("Operation not permitted") on the very first
/// `connectShare` on tvOS (and iOS), a known, long-standing libsmb2 issue on
/// those platforms (AMSMB2 #32/#63/#64). A raw `NWConnection` to port 445
/// completes a full SMB2 handshake on the same device, so an `NWConnection`-based
/// client works where libsmb2 does not. The public surface here is unchanged, so
/// `SMBIOReader`, `SMBURL`, and existing callers are untouched.
///
/// Concurrency: reads are driven one at a time on the engine's demux thread via
/// `SMBIOReader`'s semaphore, and `SMBClient`'s `Connection` serialises each
/// request/response round-trip internally, so `@unchecked Sendable` is safe for
/// this access pattern (as it was for the AMSMB2 backend).
