/// #377: the read path a host gets by asking for `LoadOptions.heldSourceConnection`.
///
/// The default reader asks the origin for a new range every `winLowWater` of drain, because a
/// `URLSessionDataTask` has no way to say "stop sending". It cannot be suspended (#220 measured
/// the suspend advisory, 911 MB arrived after it) and a task that does park holds a dormant flow
/// whose closed receive window takes every other Network.framework flow in the process down with
/// it (#310), so since 6.11.0 the connection is ENDED at the high water instead. Against an origin
/// that refuses new requests for minutes at a stretch, that request cadence is the whole defect:
/// any reader issuing one request per 8 to 16 MB will issue one inside a refusal window, on any
/// long file.
///
/// `URLSessionStreamTask` reads are demand driven, so this path asks once and pulls. The framing
/// is ours, which is the bounded work the whole question turned on:
///
/// - **HTTP/1.1 only.** No ALPN negotiation, no h2. An origin that only serves h2 is out of scope
///   for this flag, which is one of the reasons it is opt in rather than the default.
/// - **The system proxy configuration is not in this path.** A stream task connects to a host and
///   port; `URLRequest`'s proxy handling does not apply.
/// - **TLS is the OS's**, through `startSecureConnection()` with `EngineTLS.sessionDelegate` on the
///   session, so a host trust decision reaches it the same way it reaches every other engine
///   session.
///
/// Backpressure is the delegate's to spend, not this class's: `heldConnectionPullBudget` is asked
/// before every read and its answer is how many bytes are wanted. Returning 0 ends the connection.
/// The reason that matters is #310's dose, which is the LENGTH of a dormant stretch rather than its
/// existence: a pull reader that tops the window up as the consumer takes bytes is dormant for
/// chunk size over media rate, and a reader that stops pulling entirely (a paused viewer) has to
/// end the connection instead, which is what a 0 budget is for.
