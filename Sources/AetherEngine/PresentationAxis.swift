/// - **Source-PTS axis**: the timestamps the decoder/producer/subtitle readers work in. For a normal file
///   this starts at ~0; for a Blu-ray/DVD title it starts at clip 0's STC base (the TRON multi-clip titles
///   start at 599s / 4199s), because the raw m2ts/VOB clocks are not zero-based.
/// - **Display axis**: the 0-based `[0, duration]` axis the scrubber shows and the host seeks against. A disc
///   title's `duration` is the 0-based MPLS/IFO playlist length, so the published playhead must match it.
///
/// `sourcePresentationOrigin` is the source PTS that maps to display-0 (0 for normal/live, clip 0's base for a
/// disc title). These helpers keep every public playhead/seek conversion in one place so the sign is obvious
/// and unit-testable; `sourceTime` and the internal producer/subtitle axes stay on the source-PTS axis.

/// the source PTS that `duration` is measured from. A VOD loopback session takes it from the container
/// (`HLSVideoEngine.sourceStartSeconds`) the moment the session starts; this policy decides what the
/// producer's later shift publications may do to it:
///
/// - A disc title re-reads it from every publish: its raw PTS starts at clip 0's STC base, that same
///   base is what each publish carries, and a title switch inside one session moves it (AE#105).
/// - Any other VOD source keeps what it has. The first publish still seeds it when nothing else did,
///   but later publishes fold producer drift into the shift (1.96 s on the measured run), so following
///   them would drag the display axis around under a picture that has not moved.
/// - Live keeps origin 0: its public axis is the source axis by contract, which is what the live edge
///   and the DVR window are expressed against.
///
/// Without the VOD latch the published clock kept the origin in it: a 60 s-origin transport stream
/// opened its scrubber at 1:02 of a ten-minute item, and at broadcast scale a seek target computed on
/// that axis resolved outside the item and landed at the start of the file (AE#270).
