/// stored.
///
/// A PGS display set has no end of its own, so "no packet between this set and the playhead" is how
/// the drain decides that a set decoded behind a seek landing is the line still on screen there.
/// That inference is worth exactly as much as the reading behind it. Where a run was abandoned
/// mid-flight and its successor re-anchored somewhere else, the span between them was never read,
/// and a set stranded on the near side of that hole keeps looking active for as long as the store
/// stays empty in front of it: the reporter's case is a set whose authored clear lies inside the
/// hole, published over a scene ten seconds later and closed at the far side of the silence.
///
/// #362 round 2 established that no arrangement of the packets that DID arrive can show this. A
/// reader restarted BEHIND leaves a descending harvest sequence at the boundary, but one re-anchored
/// FORWARD hangs its packets in ascending order behind the stretch it skipped, so the pair looks
/// exactly like an authored silence. The ledger was named there as the precise signal and left
/// unbuilt for want of a reproducible defect; #416 is that defect.
///
/// Every note is a whole span, stated by the reader that read it: an anchor says where a run began,
/// progress says how far that run has got, and a run is contiguous by construction because a
/// demuxer reads forwards. Closed runs merge into a sorted, disjoint list. `covers` answers the one
/// question the drain asks, which is not "is there a packet here" but "did anyone look".
