/// The teardown used to leave no trace at all. `#151 forward prefetch exited (reason=cancelled
/// cancelled=true)` says only that somebody called `cancel()`, and the cancel itself printed
/// nothing, so a field capture showing a prefetcher that stops seven seconds into a session and
/// never comes back is indistinguishable from a teardown, a track switch and a rebuild. Two
/// investigations reconstructed it from the adjacency of unrelated lines instead (the whole-file
/// reader that opened 67 microseconds later), which is a reading, not a reading of the log.
///
/// Every teardown route carries one of these, so the line names the caller's intent rather than
/// the mechanism they share.
