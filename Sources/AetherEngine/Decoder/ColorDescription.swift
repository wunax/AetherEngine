/// A decoded `AVFrame` carries what the BITSTREAM declared: libavcodec writes the VUI, and a VUI that
/// says nothing leaves the fields `unspecified` rather than falling back to anything. `AVCodecParameters`
/// carries what the CONTAINER declared (Matroska's Colour element, MP4's `colr`), which for a remux is
/// routinely the only place the description exists at all. Neither is authoritative alone, and reading
/// one where the other was meant is what made an HDR still lose its tone map: the extractor gated on
/// `codecpar` (PQ) and handed zscale the frame (unspecified), and zimg has no path to linear from
/// nothing.
///
/// Same shape as `SoftwareVideoDecoder.declaredStreamSAR(bitstream:container:)`, and for the same
/// reason: two declarations of one fact, resolved once so every consumer sees the same answer.
