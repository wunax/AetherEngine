///
/// The recoveries above this one all answer the same bytes again: the #93 revive reloads the item at
/// the position that died, and the stage-2 chain refills the same segment. Against a transient that
/// is exactly right. Against a segment Apple's parser refuses on its merits it is a loop, and the
/// reporter's capture shows it ending the session with the replacement item dying 62 ms after the
/// first. `SoftwarePlaybackHost` decodes with libavcodec, which skips such a frame and plays on, and
/// it reads the demuxer directly rather than the loopback HLS, so it steps around a local-server
/// wedge too.
///
/// The rebuild is `reloadAtCurrentPosition(applying:)`, which keeps the session: same playhead, same
/// subtitle carryover, same external-track registry. Its own `decodePathRefusal` is what decides
/// whether the software path can serve this source at all, so a source it cannot serve costs a
/// refusal here rather than a second dead session.
