/// Every reload path snapshots what it restores immediately before its own `stopInternal`: the
/// #170 subtitle carryover, the audio pick, the disc title (#67). That contract holds only while
/// teardown and reload are the same call. The paused-background teardown (#127) breaks it: it runs
/// `stopInternal` when the app goes to sleep, and the reload happens on foreground return minutes
/// later, by which time the state the reload would snapshot is already wiped. The reload then
/// restored nothing, which for subtitles means no drain target and total silence on every delivery
/// instrument. So the teardown takes the snapshot itself and parks it here for the reload to claim.
