/// #357: one line stating what a subtitle drain tick did with the packets it found, so that
/// "nothing appeared on screen" can be attributed from outside instead of guessed at.
///
/// The report this exists for read the absence of `[applySubtitleEvent #N]` lines as proof that
/// cue delivery had died. That line could not carry the claim, for three reasons that are worth
/// keeping written down, because each of them is a way a diagnostic can lie by omission:
///
/// - It was capped at 20 emissions per `load()`. A session went blind after the twentieth event
///   and every seek after that landed unobserved, which reads exactly like permanent starvation.
/// - It is emitted BEFORE `applyEventMutations`, so it sits ahead of the stale-arrival gate, the
///   reconstruction hold, the PGS trim and the sorted insert. It witnesses that an event carrying
///   cues was decoded, never that a cue reached the overlay.
/// - It skips events without cues, and a zero-object PGS clear is exactly that: the composition
///   that RETIRES the visible line. The one event class that changes the screen to empty was the
///   one class the log could not show.
///
/// `SubtitleResolutionStatement` (#250) does not answer this either, and deliberately so: it states
/// how far determination reaches, not what was delivered. Its `decodedThrough` rides the drain
/// cursor, which advances over every packet handed to the decoder whether or not the decoder built
/// anything from it. A window of packets that all fail to decode therefore advances the resolution
/// line at full pace while the screen stays as it was. That combination is unremarkable in the log
/// and is the shape every "resolution keeps up but nothing renders" report has had.
///
/// So the counts here are per tick and pre-interpretation: packets found, events decoded, cues
/// carried, cues the gate admitted, cues the store actually took. The outcome label is a reading
/// aid over those numbers, never a substitute for them.
