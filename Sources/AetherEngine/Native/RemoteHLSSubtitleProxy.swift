/// AE#495: a host has answered `EngineTLS.serverTrustEvaluator`, and AVPlayer asks no delegate about a
/// certificate inside its own networking, so the media has to move onto a session the engine owns. An
/// `HLSOriginRelay` mounted on the same server does that.

/// through the relay, so a self-signed origin with sidecars gets both rather than choosing. With only

/// one variant for the program duration and the VOD verdict), a rewrite, a socket. Anything that does
/// not line up, and the sidecars stay overlay-only exactly as before. A load is never failed over a
/// subtitle feature. A refusal with a relay wanted still stands the relay up on its own, because the
