///
/// The demux and feeder loops park on a paused transport, which is right once a picture is up and
/// wrong before it: nothing is decoded, the layer never becomes ready for display, and the viewer
/// looks at black for as long as the session stays paused. Measured on the harness
/// (`play --live --sw --host-calls pausestart`): eight paused ticks of `enq=+0 status=unknown r4d=n`,
/// and the reporter's Apple TV showed the same line after a foreground retune paused a fresh tune. A
/// native session paused at the same moment shows its first frame.
///
/// So until that frame is in, a pause stops the CLOCK and not the loops.
