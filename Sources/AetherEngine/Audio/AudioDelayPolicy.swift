/// AE#464: where a host's audio-delay nudge lands, per video route.
///
/// Lip-sync error is a property of the viewer's chain (a soundbar or AVR adding video-processing
/// latency, or the reverse), not of the file, so the correction is a per-setup nudge the host sets
/// once and the engine honours for the life of the session. AVFoundation offers no audio-delay
/// control on either surface a host can reach (`AVPlayerItem` has none, and an HLS-streamed asset
/// vends no `AVAssetTrack` to bind an `AVAudioMix` to), so the offset has to be applied where the
/// engine still holds the timestamps. That is a different place on each route, and on both of them
/// it is the LAST place rather than the obvious one:
///
/// - `.software`: the decoded sample's stamped PTS, downstream of `AudioClockAnchor`. Applying it to
///   the container PTS upstream instead would feed the gapless predictor an offset it treats as
///   ordinary rounding jitter, so any nudge below its 100 ms discontinuity threshold would vanish
///   without a trace, and the clock-arming decision (`SWClockAnchorPolicy`) would move with it.
/// - `.loopback`: the audio timestamps written into the fMP4 segments. Segments already cut carry
///   the old offset, and the two are not splicable: at the seam the audio track gains a gap or an
///   overlap of exactly the change, and a change that moves audio EARLIER walks into
///   `OutputTimestampSanitizer`'s strictly-increasing-DTS rule, which clamps it away entirely. A new
///   value is therefore a new muxer, which is a re-cut at the playhead.
///
/// In both cases the offset moves AUDIO and never the stream the session reports its position on, so
/// `currentTime`, seeking and the subtitle axis are untouched by a nudge.
