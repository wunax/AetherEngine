/// Transcoding bridge for the HLS-fMP4 pipeline's audio sidecar. Decodes a source stream (TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD MA,

/// alongside video in the same fMP4 fragments.
///
/// Motivation: AVPlayer's fMP4 path decodes AAC/AC3/EAC3 (incl. Atmos JOC)/FLAC/ALAC/MP3/Opus directly, but FFmpeg's
/// mp4 muxer can't always stream-copy EAC3 from MKV (the dec3 box needs pre-parsed extradata MKV CodecPrivate often
/// lacks -> avformat_write_header -22 EINVAL); TrueHD/DTS aren't legal in fMP4 per ISOBMFF+HLS spec. FLAC and EAC3
/// are legal and decode everywhere on Apple devices, so reroute through one.
///
/// Atmos object metadata survives neither mode (TrueHD-MAT objects interleaved in the source, FFmpeg's EAC3 encoder
/// produces no JOC, FLAC has no object channel concept). EAC3+JOC sources stay lossless via the stream-copy path
/// that bypasses this bridge; only non-stream-copyable sources enter here.

/// LPCM-stereo-only install base is the consumer majority).

///     caps at 5.1 (7.1 loses SL/SR), but surround works on essentially every AVR + soundbar including LPCM-stereo-
///     only routes (Sonos Arc, Samsung HW-Q, Bose) where FLAC falls down.
///   - `.lossless`: FLAC up to 7.1, AVPlayer -> LPCM HDMI route. Needs a multichannel-LPCM sink (Denon/Marantz/NAD);
