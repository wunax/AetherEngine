/// a bitstream whose VUI declares BT.2020 YCbCr with a PQ or HLG transfer. IPT-PQ-c2 has no VUI code
/// point, so a genuine Profile 5 leaves `matrix_coeffs` and `transfer_characteristics` unspecified, and
/// a record that fills them in contradicts itself. Served as the record asks, the decoder reads YCbCr as
/// IPT and the picture comes out green / violet (#4, #176).
///
/// The RPU settles which half is lying, without a heuristic: a Profile 5 RPU cannot carry a residual or
/// an NLQ, so an RPU that carries one was authored for a different profile. libdovi answers it in one
/// field, and the engine already parses RPUs on this path for the Profile 7 conversion.
