    /// For a host whose UI knows what comes next: the next episode, the item under the cursor. A
    /// cold open is two to three sequential round trips before the first sample read on a
    /// non-fast-start MP4, and on a slow origin the first byte of the data connection is the whole
    /// perceived start time. Those are spendable in advance, and this is how a host spends them.
    ///
    /// `nonisolated` and `static`: warming needs no engine, no audio session and no layer, so a
    /// host warms while its player is still on the current item. Call it from a detached task.
    ///
    /// What it does: one ranged GET from byte zero for `byteBudget` bytes, plus a second one for
    /// the trailing object only where the head says a cold open would go looking for it (an MP4
    /// whose `moov` sits behind the media). The bytes are held in memory, keyed by the exact URL,
    /// and the first `load()` of that URL takes them. They do not survive the app, and they are not
    /// a download: this is a head start, not an offline copy.
    ///
    /// What it deliberately does not do:
    ///
    /// - **It never queues for the origin.** A warm takes a request slot only if one is free right
    ///   now, and declines when the origin is metered down to one request at a time or is pacing
    ///   the engine (#377). A prewarm that would have to wait for the playing session's uplink has
    ///   stopped helping, and the report says so.
    /// - **It does not apply to `LoadOptions.nativeRemoteHLS`.** On that route AVPlayer issues the
    ///   requests and the engine sees none of them, so there is nothing here to adopt.
    ///
    /// Cancelling the task cancels the fetch and stores nothing: a host that has moved on must not
    /// find half a source warm for a URL it left behind.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - url: The exact source URL a later `load()` will use. A signed URL warmed under one
    ///     signature is not adopted under another, which is the conservative reading and the only
    ///     one that cannot serve the wrong bytes.
    ///   - httpHeaders: The same headers the load will carry (`LoadOptions.httpHeaders`), for
    ///     origins that enforce Referer / User-Agent / Authorization.
    ///   - byteBudget: How many bytes to retain from the head. Defaults to
    ///     ``defaultPrewarmByteBudget``.
    /// - Returns: A ``SourcePrewarmReport`` naming what was retained, or why nothing was.
