// MARK: - customio --live

/// AE#445 repro shape: a host-owned live spool behind `MediaSource.custom`.
///
/// The reporter's adapter is a ring over a disk-backed spool fed by one continuous upstream
/// socket. Four properties of that shape decide how the engine treats the source, and all four
/// are reproduced here rather than approximated:
///
///  - **Never EOF.** At the live edge `read` blocks until the pacer releases more bytes; it never
///    returns 0, so nothing downstream can terminate on end of stream.
///  - **Paced at the mux rate.** A file read at disk speed parks the producer on backpressure
///    within seconds and then reads almost nothing, which is the opposite of a live session. The
///    pacer releases `rateBytesPerSecond` against a wall clock, so the demux thread spends the
///    session where a real one does: blocked at the edge.
///  - **Unknown size.** `AVSEEK_SIZE` answers negative (`--unknown-size`, the default here), so
///    the engine has no byte axis to bound anything by.
///  - **Seekable by logical offset.** `SEEK_SET`/`SEEK_CUR` succeed inside the delivered span,
///    which is what makes `CustomIOReaderBridge.isSeekable` true. A forward-only reader takes a
///    different route through the engine and would answer a different question.
///
/// **The reader allocates nothing per read, and that is the point.** AE#445 round 1 measured this
/// harness with a `FileHandle.readData` reader, which strands one autoreleased `Data` per read on
/// the pump thread. It reproduced the reporter's signature exactly (retention ratio 1.00) and the
/// pool fix flattened it, but the reporter's own adapter reads with `pread` into the engine's
/// buffer and allocates nothing, so that run measured the HARNESS rather than his case. The default
/// arm is therefore the allocation-free one: what it measures is the engine. `--foundation-reader`
/// restores the allocating arm, which is now a control for the pool rather than the subject.
/// AE#445 round 3: the ingest-side carry, as a POSITIVE control.
///
/// The reporter's census named his growing block precisely: one `REALLOC`-tagged allocation on an
/// exact x1.25 ladder whose content is every byte the session consumed. That factor is Foundation's,
/// not libav's (`Data.__DataStorage._grow` adds `newLength >> 2` above 128 KB; `av_fast_realloc`
/// adds a sixteenth, the AVIO dynamic buffer a half), so the block is a Swift `Data`, and the one
/// `Data` shape that grows like that while its `count` stays small is a parse carry consumed from
/// the front with `removeFirst`: that only advances the slice's lower bound, so the backing store
/// keeps every byte below it and reallocs to fit the ever-rising upper bound. The engine paid for
/// this lesson twice on its own readers (70430de, `ByteFIFO`) and re-bases with `subdata` in both.
///
/// `--host-carry removeFirst` puts that shape back into the harness on purpose, so the tool that
/// measures the engine at ratio 0.00 can also produce the reporter's ratio 1.00 on demand and name
/// the cause. `--host-carry subdata` is the same carry re-based, which is the fix.
