## [Unreleased]

## [5.8.6] - 2026-07-18

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.8.6))

### Changed

- **Cleared five Swift 6 `SendableClosureCaptures` warnings in the AVIO size-probe.** The staggered-concurrent open-time size probe (#107 follow-up) kept its `resolvedSize` / `outstanding` counters as mutable locals and passed each probe as a plain `() -> Int64` thunk, so Swift 6 flagged the `asyncAfter` `@Sendable` closures. The synchronisation was already correct (every touch guarded by one `NSCondition`); the shared state now lives in a condition-guarded `@unchecked Sendable` box and the probe thunk is `@Sendable`. No behaviour change; the package builds warning-free under Swift 6. Surfaced while sweeping build warnings for the Sodalite 1.0 release.

## [5.8.5] - 2026-07-18

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.8.5))

### Fixed

- **Recurring green flicker mid-stream on live MPEG-TS channels whose encoder restarts or splices in place (#133 follow-up).** The #133 join gate covered joining a broadcast mid-stream, but the same "non-existing PPS/SPS referenced" decode condition recurred later in the same session on some UK terrestrial channels via Xtream, showing as green frames that came back throughout playback rather than only at tune-in. The fMP4 `avcC` (SPS/PPS) freezes at `avformat_write_header`, and the versioned-init rotation that re-establishes it only fired for an SSAI program switch on a new video PID. An in-band parameter-set change on the *same* PID (encoder restart or regional opt-out splice) forced only a discontinuity cut, so the panel kept decoding the new slices against the stale `avcC`. Each mid-stream keyframe now compares its in-band SPS/PPS against the sets backing the current `avcC` and, on a divergence, rotates the muxer through the same versioned EXT-X-MAP path, parsing the sets directly so it works whether or not the demuxer surfaces the change as side data. A same-PID change keeps the program's Dolby Vision / colour signaling; only an ad creative on a new PID drops it. Reported with precise logs by digilearn-dev. This build also adds diagnostics (per-epoch video PID, parameter-set-change counter, and DisplayCriteria skip-signature logging) to confirm the path on retest.

## [5.8.4] - 2026-07-18

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.8.4))

### Fixed

- **Teletext captions no longer render a blank line between two lines placed on non-adjacent rows (#107).** libzvbi joins teletext rows with `\N`, so a two-line caption whose lines sit on non-adjacent rows (an empty middle row used only for vertical placement) arrived as `line1\n\nline2` and showed a blank line the broadcaster never intended. The 5.8.0 edge-trim only removed leading and trailing newlines; interior runs of consecutive newlines now fold to a single break too, on both the plain and coloured teletext paths. Single line breaks between adjacent rows are preserved. Reported by tresby, who device-verified the 801 page override and hardware deinterlace on real AU streams in the same pass.

## [5.8.3] - 2026-07-18

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.8.3))

### Fixed

- **iOS / tvOS build fix for the #2 decodability probe.** `VTCapabilityProbe.canHardwareDecode` used `kVTVideoDecoderSpecification_RequireHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoder` without the iOS 17 / tvOS 17 availability guard (the symbol did not exist on iOS before 17), so 5.8.2 compiled on macOS but failed the iOS / tvOS simulator build. Guarded the same way `HardwareVideoDecoder` does. No behavior change on shipping deployment targets. macOS (AetherPlayer) was unaffected in 5.8.2.

## [5.8.2] - 2026-07-18

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.8.2))

### Fixed

- **H.264 / HEVC formats VideoToolbox cannot hardware-decode now fall back to software instead of a black screen (#2).** H.264 High 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 / High-10 and HEVC Rext are accepted by AVPlayer at the HLS CODECS level (the item reaches `readyToPlay`), but on hardware without a VideoToolbox decoder for the profile (Intel Macs, older Apple TV chips) the native path then renders nothing, while QuickTime plays the same file via its own software decoder. A per-format `VTDecompressionSession` probe at load (`VTCapabilityProbe.canHardwareDecode`) now routes these sources to the `SoftwarePlaybackHost` (libavcodec), which decodes them. Apple Silicon has hardware decoders for all of these and keeps them on the native path unchanged. Reported by DrHurt.

## [5.8.1] - 2026-07-18

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.8.1))

### Fixed

- **Dolby Vision P7 conversion failures degrade to clean HDR10 instead of shipping mixed-profile DV (#135).** When libdovi cannot convert a P7 RPU to P8.1 on the loopback-HLS producer path, the offending RPU (and its enhancement-layer NAL) is now dropped rather than muxed through, so the affected frame plays as the clean HDR10 base instead of riding a P7 RPU inside a container already declared 8.1. Well-formed remuxes never reach this path and are unaffected. Field notes from rrgomes.

### Added

- **Full Enhancement Layer (FEL) sources are logged during P7 to P8.1 conversion (#135).** The first RPU's enhancement-layer type is probed once; a FEL source (whose enhancement layer is discarded in the single-layer conversion, unlike a MEL source where the drop is lossless) now emits a one-line log, so a flatter-looking FEL disc can be triaged against a native P7 player. Also surfaced on `DoviConvertProbeResult.enhancementLayerType` for `aetherctl dovitest` validation. Thanks to rrgomes.

## [5.8.0] - 2026-07-18

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.8.0))

### Added

- **Hardware deinterlacing with smooth field-rate motion (#107).** Interlaced broadcast on the software-decode path (MPEG-2 / VC-1 / MPEG-4 and interlaced H.264) now deinterlaces on the GPU via `yadif_videotoolbox` (the yadif kernel as a Metal compute shader over VideoToolbox frames) and, by default, at field rate (`send_field`: 25i to 50p, 29.97i to 59.94p) for smooth motion on sport. `LoadOptions.deinterlaceMode` (default `.auto`) selects the hardware graph with a software bwdif fallback (no Metal device, an older linked FFmpeg, or a graph-build failure all fall back cleanly); `LoadOptions.deinterlaceFieldRate` (default `.field`) controls cadence. The hardware sink emits IOSurface-backed CVPixelBuffers copied GPU-side into the decoder's own pool, skipping the sws_scale copy. Requires FFmpegBuild 2.1.0 (pulled transitively), which also carries a patch balancing an over-release of the autoreleased Metal command-buffer/encoder in the upstream VT filter (a candidate for ffmpeg-devel). Adopts and thanks tresby (whose fork this ports) and nathanpiper.

### Fixed

- **Coloured teletext captions no longer render a leading blank line (#107).** libzvbi teletext ASS can prefix a row-positioning newline; the plain-text path trimmed it but the coloured (rich-text) path did not, so a coloured caption showed a blank line the same page without colour would not. The colour parser now edge-trims leading and trailing whitespace and newlines across the run sequence, matching the plain path (interior line breaks and colours preserved). Reported by tresby.

## [5.7.0] - 2026-07-18

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.7.0))

### Added

- **Coloured DVB teletext captions (#107).** Teletext subtitles now decode through libzvbi as ASS (`txt_format=ass`) so the per-character colour broadcasters use to distinguish speakers survives to the overlay. A new `SubtitleCue.Body.richText([SubtitleTextRun])` carries the coloured runs (each run an RGB `SubtitleColor?`, nil meaning "use the host default"); `cue.text` still flattens rich cues to plain text so existing text consumers are unchanged, and an all-white page keeps emitting plain `.text`. Both reference hosts render the coloured runs. Thanks to tresby and nathanpiper.
- **Teletext caption-page override (#107).** `LoadOptions.teletextPage` selects the teletext page libzvbi decodes (default nil = auto-detect the flagged subtitle page). Channels whose captions ride a page libzvbi does not flag as a subtitle page (for example Australian free-to-air on page 801) can now be targeted explicitly; the option threads through every subtitle tap site.

### Fixed

- **Coloured teletext cues are trimmed and de-duplicated in the retained store like plain ones (#107).** The teletext successor-trim and the live-DVR re-decode de-dupe were text-cue-only; coloured pages (now rich-text cues) are handled by both, so a coloured caption is closed by its successor instead of lingering to the page-hold cap, and does not duplicate across a live-DVR seek.

## [5.6.2] - 2026-07-17

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.6.2))

### Fixed

- **Live H.264 channels joining mid-broadcast no longer green-flash or die with an empty playlist (#133).** On the MPEG-TS ingest path the video gate opened on any keyframe-flagged packet without confirming a decodable IDR access unit. Joining a running broadcast, that meant the decoder briefly rendered an uninitialized reference (green frame) until the real SPS/PPS/IDR arrived, or, when the probe joined before any SPS and left `codecpar` at 0x0, the first muxer allocation fed 0x0 dimensions into `avformat_write_header` (-22) and the channel produced an empty `#EXTM3U` that never recovered. A live-only pre-gate (H.264 with Annex-B framing) now withholds video until a packet carries in-band SPS + PPS and a true IDR slice, and reconstructs the muxer's dimensions from those in-band parameter sets when the probe left them unresolved. A miss is covered by the existing bounded live keyframe-gate timeout (reopen), not a terminal muxer failure. fMP4 live and VOD are unaffected.
- **Same-format live zaps no longer pay the full display-mode settle cap (#133).** Zapping between two channels of the same format (e.g. two SDR 50 Hz channels) re-applied identical `AVDisplayCriteria`, which on unobservable-Dolby-Vision panels started a mode switch the app cannot observe and made the post-load settle wait burn its full ~3s cap on every zap. The engine now retains the last-applied criteria and skips both the redundant panel write and the settle wait when the incoming criteria are already active, cutting that redundant latency to zero. Any zap that actually changes format, rate, or dynamic range settles exactly as before. Thanks to digilearn-dev for the detailed report and reproduction.

## [5.6.1] - 2026-07-17

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.6.1))

### Fixed

- **A diagnostics tick can no longer hang or kill the host app (#134).** On the native path the 1 Hz `LiveTelemetrySampler.tick` made up to six synchronous AVFoundation reads per second on the main actor; each is a sync XPC round-trip to mediaserverd, so a momentarily busy media server (a display-mode change on an HDR start, for example) parked the main thread in `mach_msg` and surfaced in production hosts as fully blocked app hangs and watchdog terminations. The reads now run as one coalesced batch (one `accessLog()`, one `currentTime()`) on a dedicated background queue, and a tick that resumes after a stop or reload seam drops its stale snapshot instead of publishing it into the new session. The same class of read existed in the 30 s memory probe (now hopped through the same helper) and in the host's `seekableEnd`, which live clock-tick sinks and the paused-live 1 Hz window timer read per call and is now a KVO mirror of `seekableTimeRanges`. As a side effect, the `[LagDiag]` line no longer pays any AVFoundation cost when verbose logging is disabled. Thanks to l984-451 for the Sentry-backed report, the exact read inventory, and the off-main fix proposal.

## [5.6.0] - 2026-07-17

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.6.0))

### Added

- **A53/SEI-embedded CEA-608 captions are now extracted and rendered (#131).** US broadcast and cable-sourced feeds carry closed captions as ATSC A/53 `cc_data` inside the video bitstream rather than as a demuxable caption stream, so the #77 closed-caption tap never armed and captioned live channels played with no subtitle option. The segment producer now scans H.264/HEVC video packets for `user_data_registered_itu_t_t35` SEI (GA94), reorders the decode-order caption groups to presentation order, and feeds the existing line-21 decoder; the software-decode path (MPEG-2 and friends) feeds the same tap from `AV_FRAME_DATA_A53_CC` decoded-frame side data. A synthetic `eia_608` track surfaces lazily on the first real caption pair, so uncaptioned channels never show a dead menu entry and hosts need no changes. Overlay-only for now (no native WebVTT rendition); CEA-708 stays out of scope, matching #77's field-1/CC1 first cut. Thanks to dlev02 for the precise engine audit that scoped the fix.

## [5.5.1] - 2026-07-17

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.5.1))

### Fixed

- **Live HDR10 channels no longer fail at startup with -1002 (#130).** AVPlayer filters a `VIDEO-RANGE=PQ`/`HLG` variant without a `FRAME-RATE` attribute out of the master playlist at parse time and fails the item with NSURLErrorDomain -1002 before ever fetching the media playlist. Live MPEG-TS probes can leave `avg_frame_rate` unset, so live HDR sessions could serve exactly that master with no recovery path. The manifest frame rate now falls back to `r_frame_rate`, a source with no detectable frame rate routes media-direct instead of serving an unloadable master, and a startup -1002 while serving the master reactively falls back to the media playlist (live sessions rejoin at the edge). Thanks to digilearn-dev.

## [5.5.0] - 2026-07-17

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.5.0))

### Changed

- **FFmpeg now ships as dynamically linked frameworks (FFmpegBuild 2.0.0).** The FFmpeg xcframeworks were static archives that SPM linked into the app binary, which left closed-source App Store adopters without a realistic LGPL compliance path. They are now dynamic frameworks that Xcode embeds and signs in the app bundle automatically; no integration changes are needed. FFmpegBuild 2.0.0 also corrects the license statement (the FFmpeg parts are LGPL-2.1-or-later, not LGPL-3.0) and excludes libzvbi's GPL-2 sources from the build, so no GPL code ships in the binaries. The README's License section now spells out that the engine's store exception does not extend to FFmpeg and what adopters have to do instead. Thanks to the adopter whose licensing review flagged the contradiction.

## [5.4.1] - 2026-07-17

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.4.1))

### Fixed

- **A native seek can no longer suspend the caller past its 8 s budget (#129).** The old deadline path retried the seek with an unbounded await, so repeated source stalls could leave `seek(to:)` suspended for 40+ s. The deadline now reconciles the public clock to the rendered frame and returns; the original AVPlayer seek stays alive as the recovery intent, and a late landing settles clock, transport state, and subtitle re-anchoring after the fact (both orderings of the completion/deadline race on the MainActor are handled). The producer is restarted only when it is genuinely starved; a healthy-but-slow producer keeps its progress. Thanks to thatcube.
- **Interior sparse-cache holes no longer burn a 2 s wait the producer can never fill (#129).** A cache index inside the stored min/max range is not proof of residency after scrubbing leaves retained bands. The fetch path now waits only when the active producer's forward march actually covers the requested index, and restarts immediately otherwise. Thanks to thatcube.
- **A starved seek landing with a paused `timeControlStatus` and playing intent no longer latches paused.** The seek finalize now reconciles transport from live AVPlayer status: external AVKit / MediaRemote play or pause issued during a seek wins, while the bounded stall-recovery window reasserts play over a spurious pause (the #122 guarantee is unchanged: a paused scrub still lands paused).

## [5.4.0] - 2026-07-17

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.4.0))

### Added

- **`stop(resetDisplayCriteria:)` lets a handoff stop preserve the panel's HDMI mode (#128).** Nil-ing `preferredDisplayCriteria` during a same-mode stop()/load() handoff bounced tvOS through SDR before re-negotiating the same Dolby Vision mode. `stop(resetDisplayCriteria: false)` keeps the criteria applied so the next `load()` overwrites it in place; the plain `stop()` default is unchanged. Thanks to thatcube for the fix, verified on real hardware.

### Fixed

- **Back-to-back `load()` calls no longer bounce the panel through SDR (#128 follow-up).** The engine's own load-over-load seam (e.g. a next-episode handoff that reloads in place) reset the criteria the same way before `apply()` re-negotiated. The seam now preserves the criteria; audio-only sessions and suppressed (AVKit-sole-writer) hosts clear a leftover criteria at routing time instead, so music playback cannot keep the panel in DV/HDR and dual writers cannot fight.

## [5.3.1] - 2026-07-16

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.3.1))

### Fixed

- **Credential headers are no longer replayed onto cross-origin redirect targets (#126 follow-up).** The redirect handler shared by the persistent reader and both size probes reapplied every caller-supplied header, including `Authorization`, to whatever URL a redirect landed on. A media server 307-redirecting to a cross-origin presigned object-storage URL (query-string auth) then rejected the request with 400 (two conflicting auth mechanisms), every probe went blind, and the reader degraded to forward-only streaming mode, breaking moov-at-end MP4s against a fully byte-seekable target. It also disclosed the media-server token to foreign hosts. Credentials (`Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `Cookie`, Emby/Jellyfin token headers) are now replayed only to a same-host target with no TLS downgrade; `Range` and non-credential extra headers still survive cross-host redirects for header-dependent proxies (#8 behavior unchanged). Thanks to YangHanqing for the precise A/B diagnosis.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-07-16

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.3.0))

### Added

- **Live audio delivery is decoupled from video decode pace (#107).** The software live (DVR) feeder fed audio interleaved behind the video renderer's back-pressure gate, capping the audio renderer's lead over the clock below one second; on devices where software 1080i decode plus deinterlacing runs near real time that margin is zero and every feeder stall was an audible dropout. An audio look-ahead pump now decodes and enqueues audio from the DVR ring up to a 4 s lead independent of the video path, so a slow video decode degrades to late video frames under smooth audio. DVR seeks reset the pump cursor atomically alongside the combined cursor.
- **Live-edge source underruns pause and rebuffer instead of chopping forever (#107).** When the source itself briefly delivers below real time and playback drains the ring at the live edge, the free-running synchronizer clock used to outrun the stream permanently, leaving every later sample in the clock's past (continuous chopping that never recovered). The clock now pauses at 0.15 s of remaining audio lead, refills, and resumes at 2 s, mirroring AVPlayer's stall handling on the native path.
- **`aetherctl play --audio-stats` and `--host-calls seekback`.** The play harness can now tap the decoded PCM and report per-second audio lead plus source-PTS continuity gaps, and script a DVR rewind plus live-edge return; this is the tooling the audio-chopping report was diagnosed and verified with.

## [5.2.1] - 2026-07-16

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.2.1))

### Changed

- **Open-time size probes run concurrently (#107 follow-up).** The Range / HEAD / bounded-range fallback ladder for origins whose data connection resolves no length ran sequentially, tripling open latency on genuinely length-less sources (each probe pays the origin's full connect latency). The primary open-ended range probe still fires first and alone; the two fallbacks start 750 ms later in parallel, first positive size wins. Origins that resolve the primary inside the stagger window see identical wire traffic. Verified 17.2 s to 12.1 s against a 3 s-latency length-less origin; probe requests and budgets unchanged.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-07-16

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.2.0))

### Added

- **Teletext subtitles render on the overlay with page-state semantics (#107).** DVB teletext (libzvbi) captions now reach `subtitleCues` on every software session shape. libzvbi emits page content open-ended ("until replaced") and page erases as rect-less clear events; both now carry a text trim that closes earlier open cues at the event start, so live roll-up captions build and replace cleanly instead of accumulating. Open-ended windows are additionally capped at 120 s as a ghost-line bound. Validated end-to-end against Australian FTA broadcasts (1080i25 H.264, captions on page 801). Thanks to tresby for the tuner access that made the live validation possible.
- **`aetherctl play`.** Full load+play session smoke test: 1 Hz transport telemetry, `--live` / `--dvr-window`, `--subs <codec-or-lang>` cue logging, and `--host-calls` mimicry of host post-load call sequences. Fails loud when the clock does not advance or a selected subtitle track produces no cues.

### Fixed

- **Mid-stream-joined sources no longer freeze on the first frame (#107).** A live tuner MPEG-TS opened without `isLive`, live without a DVR window, or a capture file cut mid-broadcast delivers its first samples hours past the load anchor; the combined demux loop armed the synchronizer at the load anchor (0 on a fresh load), scheduling every A/V sample far in the future. The clock now re-anchors at the first decoded sample PTS when it deviates from the load anchor by more than 2 s (`SWClockAnchorPolicy`); positions stay session-relative through the anchor's session zero while `sourceTime` rides the raw source axis, matching the native path's split.
- **Live-DVR sessions feed subtitle packets again (#107).** The live reader loop only ring-buffered audio/video; subtitle packets never reached the session packet store, starving the overlay drainer on every live+DVR session.
- **Host rate changes before clock arming no longer wedge the session (#107).** A `setRate` issued between `load()` and the demux loop's clock arming requested a rate at a clock time where no media will ever exist; `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer`'s delayed-rate-change machinery then held the effective rate at 0 permanently. `setRate` / `pause` / play-resume now gate the synchronizer call on the armed-clock latch, and arming applies the latest host rate. `AudioOutput` logs every clock mutation.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-07-16

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.1.0))

### Added

- **Paused-background grace window on iOS (#127).** A paused session used to tear down the moment the app backgrounded, so a 10-30 s app switch paid a full pipeline rebuild. The teardown is now deferred by `backgroundTeardownGraceSeconds` (default 15 s, 0 restores the immediate teardown), held under a background-task assertion; returning inside the window resumes on the live pipeline with no reload. At expiry the background action is re-evaluated (PiP / lock-screen play can change mid-window) and the wedge-safe teardown runs while the app is still genuinely running, never across an idle suspension. A playing session with background playback disabled still tears down immediately; tvOS keeps the unconditional teardown. Thanks to dlev02 for the proposals and device logs.
- **Public `isSessionReady` (#127).** `@Published` engine flag, true once the active session's transport is ready to accept seeks and report real time (native path: AVPlayerItem readyToPlay), false across every teardown. Hosts gate corrective actions (restore watchdogs, position clamps) on it instead of inferring readiness from `currentTime` being pinned at 0.

### Fixed

- **Pre-ready host seeks no longer clamp to 0:00 (#127).** A host seek forwarded while the AVPlayer item was pre-ready clamped to 0 against empty seekable ranges and replaced `load()`'s own pending start-position seek, restarting playback from the file head. Such seeks are now deferred and the latest one replays at readiness.

## [5.0.7] - 2026-07-15

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.0.7))

### Fixed

- **Unknown-length HTTP MP4 no longer enters a seek-dependent path and silently produces zero packets (#126).** When no size probe resolved a length (an origin answering `bytes=0-` with 200/chunked and rejecting HEAD, e.g. Emby behind a buffering proxy), the AVIO reader degraded to forward-only streaming mode but still advertised itself as seekable, so the mov demuxer parsed a tail moov it could never rewind to and every sample read died with "partial file" while the host waited on a playlist that never gained a segment. Three layers: a last-resort bounded `bytes=0-1` range probe recovers the real size from origins that honor ranges but omit lengths on open-ended requests (full seekable playback, the common case); a source that genuinely resolves no size now reports itself non-seekable to both FFmpeg and the routing layer, so moov-at-end files fail cleanly at open and faststart files route to the sequential software path; and a VOD producer that dies on a read error having produced nothing now surfaces a fatal load error instead of leaving AVPlayer in `waitingToPlay` until the host's timeout. Thanks to YangHanqing for the precise log capture and the VLC control test.

## [5.0.6] - 2026-07-15

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.0.6))

### Fixed

- **Playback resumes after system audio-session interruptions that end with `.shouldResume` (Sodalite iOS device report).** The engine had no `AVAudioSession` interruption handling at all: a foreign session claiming audio (a phone call, Siri, or a live-camera PiP with record priority) paused AVPlayer through the system, and when the interruption ended playback stayed silent until a manual play. The system pause never goes through `pause()`, so the native host's durable `playIntent` (#122) survives the interruption and arms a resume; on interruption end the engine re-issues `play()` only when the system grants `.shouldResume` (a call ending, Siri dismissing). Sessions that end without it, such as a camera PiP closing, stay paused by design and resume manually. An explicit user `pause()` or stop disarms the resume; in the background only audio backends may resume. Interruptions are also logged with type, reason, options, and session state, so foreign-session conflicts are visible in captures.

## [5.0.5] - 2026-07-14

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.0.5))

### Added

- **A host can now mount media paused with `LoadOptions.autoplay` (#124).** Every load path ended in an unconditional autostart, so a host that wanted to hold a pause at mount (a synchronized-start lobby that loads several devices and starts them together on a signal, or a hold-at-mount / resume prompt) always received one engine-initiated resume at load completion and had to claw it back with a racy state-sink clamp, the same declared-versus-real split as #122/#123. `LoadOptions.autoplay` defaults to `true`, so every current caller is byte-identical. Set it to `false` and the load skips its terminal `play()` and `state = .playing` across all paths (native VOD, software, both audio backends, and the lean native remote-HLS path), leaves `playIntent` false, and settles `.loading` to `.paused` through the existing `host.$isReady` readiness waypoint; the host resumes later with `play()`. On the native VOD path the SDR-to-HDR cold-start readiness gate is skipped for a paused mount, since it is an autostart-path recovery that plays to poll readiness. The `reloadAtCurrentPosition` path (audio switch, live rejoin) is unchanged. Thanks to rrgomes for the device traces and the code-level shape of the fix.

### Fixed

- **Subtitle cues no longer starve permanently after a backward seek into cache-resident content (#125).** During a long mixed-direction seek storm on a heavy 4K Dolby Vision remux with embedded PGS and SubRip tracks, subtitle cues could stop rendering partway through and never return, each track re-arm logging `backfilled 0 cues` over an armed but empty store. The #112 overlay is fed only from the session's `SubtitlePacketStore`, whose single writer is the producer demux pump, and the playhead-paced drainer pruned that store every tick at `playhead - retentionSeconds`. A backward jump into segment-cache-resident content is served without a producer restart and the pump stays parked forward, so once a forward excursion pushed the prune cutoff past the returned region its packets were gone and never re-harvested, leaving the drain window permanently empty. The trailing time-prune is removed; the store is now bounded only by its existing per-stream byte cap (evict-oldest), so text tracks keep the whole session and bitmap tracks keep a wide trailing window, matching how the segment cache retains history for backward seeks rather than clamping to a window ahead of the playhead. A backward seek past a bitmap stream's evicted edge is a deferred windowed-re-read fallback. Thanks to rrgomes for the code-level diagnosis (the pump as the store's only writer, the cache-resident backward jump that skips the restart) and the byte-retention fix direction.

## [5.0.4] - 2026-07-13

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.0.4))

### Fixed

- **Subtitle cues no longer pace ahead of a frozen picture during a queued seek chase (#123).** Under sustained *queued* skip bursts on a heavy 4K Dolby Vision asset (a new burst issued into an unfinished settle), the engine's reported clock adopted each new target immediately while the underlying player rebuilt, and `sourceTime` (documented as the on-screen frame, not the scrub target, #49) parked tens of seconds ahead of the picture for 14 to 33 s. Any host pacing subtitle cues off `sourceTime` then rendered cues for positions 10 to 30 s ahead over a still frame until convergence. The VOD seek finalize and the native host's seek completion stamped `sourceTime` (and `renderedTime`) onto the target unconditionally at landing, but during a chase the player is `waitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate` with the picture frozen behind the target, and the 100 ms periodic observer that would walk the clock back to the rendered frame is silent while buffering, so the stamp stuck. Both stamps are now gated on whether the landed frame is actually presented: a playing or paused landing shows the target frame and settles onto it immediately (isolated and paused scrubs are unchanged), while a landing still buffering toward the target holds `sourceTime` on the rendered frame and lets the observer settle it when playback resumes and the frame is delivered. Cues glued to `sourceTime` stay glued to the picture through the chase, and `abs(currentTime - sourceTime)` stays honest as a converging gap a host can gate cue rendering on. The phase logs ruled out the producer restart coalescer (nine cheap restarts across roughly 107 seeks, the long stretches had zero rebuilds and were pure player buffering). Thanks to rrgomes for the triangulated three-clock traces and the phase breakdown that isolated the finalize stamp.

## [5.0.3] - 2026-07-12

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.0.3))

### Fixed

- **A seek issued while paused no longer re-engages playback (#122).** With playback paused by the host, a skip or scrub commit spontaneously resumed the underlying player (rate 1) with no host `play()` call. The normal seek finalize forced `state = .playing` regardless of the transport intent in effect when the seek was issued. That both reported playing after a paused scrub and weaponised the #93 stall-recovery reassert: the seek's own paused landing (`timeControlStatus == .paused`), arriving while `state == .playing` inside an open recovery window (a backward skip's rebuffer opens one), was misread as a spurious pause, so the engine called `host.play()`. The finalize now derives its state from the durable transport intent (the native host's `playIntent`, which a seek never touches), so a paused scrub lands paused, presenting the new frame, and `engineStateIsPlaying` stays honest so the reassert only fires on genuine stalls. A playing scrub is unchanged. Thanks to rrgomes for the traces isolating the three trigger points and confirming a plain pause is never affected.

## [5.0.2] - 2026-07-11

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.0.2))

### Fixed

- **Embedded SRT cues no longer duplicate after rapid seeking (#121).** The overlay drainer rebuilds the `EmbeddedSubtitleDecoder` on every seek (`.resetAndDecode`), which restarts its per-instance dedupe set and cue-id counter at zero. Because `subtitleCues` is intentionally retained across the seek, the backscan re-decoded cues still in the store, and the insert path only replaced same-start bitmap cues while always appending text cues, so identical lines accumulated (a report saw the count grow 4 to 7 to 11) and the reset decoder ids collided with retained ids (`ForEach(id:)` "occurs multiple times"). Both invariants now live at the retained-store insert funnel, which sees the whole session rather than one decoder generation: a text cue already present with the same start, end, and text is dropped (content, not id, so simultaneous distinct speaker lines and genuine repeats at new timestamps still insert), and every cue that lands is stamped with a session-monotonic id. Thanks to wunax for the source-level diagnosis and the exact repro.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-07-10

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.0.1))

### Fixed

- **Split MPEG-TS PGS display sets reassemble before decode (#112).** On Blu-ray MPEG-TS a PGS display set spans several PES packets (PCS, WDS, PDS, ODS, END). The packet-tap store kept one entry per harvested packet keyed by unique PTS, so segments without a PTS died at the NOPTS guard and segments sharing one collapsed in the same-PTS replace; the decoder never saw the palette and object definitions and every set failed at its END segment ("Invalid palette id"). The store now reassembles armed streams' chunks into one self-contained entry at the PCS presentation PTS (opens on PCS, finalizes on END, drops mid-set backfill starts, bails on missing END, backward jumps, or a 16 MiB cap). Arming comes from the demuxer (PGS streams in an mpegts container) through both hosts' tap sinks; Matroska stays on the per-packet path, where the decoder's synthetic-END flush covers stripped ENDs.
- **iOS route-sharing policy no longer blocks host PiP (#116).** The shared `AVAudioSession` declared `.longFormAudio` on every platform. On iOS that marks the process a long-form audio client, which pins `AVPictureInPictureController.isPictureInPicturePossible` to `false` for any host-built PiP controller around the engine's player layer, and hosts could not durably re-declare against the engine's detached declaration (#114). The policy is now platform-split: tvOS keeps `.longFormAudio` (HDMI route negotiation, #24), iOS declares `.default`.
- **Dolby Vision first frame no longer waits out a fixed 5 s poll (#117).** `waitForSwitch()` polled `isDisplayModeSwitchInProgress` for a fixed 5 s and never watched the OS mode-switch notifications, so on panels where a DV switch is unobservable to the app (`currentEDRHeadroom` stays 1.0 and the in-progress flag never clears even though the panel visibly enters DV) it ran the full timeout every time, and `load()` waits twice. It now settles the instant the panel reports done (`AVDisplayManagerModeSwitchStart` / `End` notifications, or EDR headroom rising) and otherwise caps the wait at ~2 s. Measured DV first frame ~10 s to ~2 s on an unobservable panel; observable panels (HDR10 / HLG, or DV panels that post the notification) settle immediately. SDR / rate-only loads are unaffected, the wait already early-exits for them. Thanks to thatcube for PR #118.
- **`LoadOptions.httpHeaders` reaches the nativeRemoteHLS path (#119).** The remote-HLS bypass built its `AVURLAsset` without an options dictionary, silently dropping the headers, so header-enforcing IPTV origins (per-stream Referer / User-Agent / Authorization) answered 403 and those channels could not play at all. The headers now ride the asset via `AVURLAssetHTTPHeaderFieldsKey`, and the remote-HLS audio tap fetcher (#95) sends the same headers on its own playlist, segment, and AES-key requests. Loopback callers pass no headers and keep their default asset unchanged.
- **Pre-bound surfaces show video on `loadRemoteHLS` (#120).** The lean remote-HLS bypass assigned its host and early-returned without presenting the player layer, so a surface bound before load (the usual SwiftUI order: view appears, then the load task fires) never attached `playerLayer` and every remote-HLS live channel played audio over black video. The layer is now presented right after the host is assigned, mirroring `loadNative`; attach is idempotent, so host-reuse and post-bind cases are unaffected.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-07-09

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/5.0.0))

### Breaking

- **`setNativeSubtitleForPiP(_:)` renamed to `setNativeSubtitleRendering(_:)`.** The native WebVTT legible rendition is selected whenever the video leaves the host's own view hierarchy (a PiP window, an AirPlay receiver, or a wired external display, Sodalite#34), where the host on-frame overlay cannot draw. The old name implied PiP-only; the behavior is general. Pure rename, no behavior change.

### Changed

- **Embedded subtitle overlay pipeline reworked: packet tap replaces the side-demuxer readers (#112).** The overlay path used to open a second demuxer per selected embedded subtitle track and seek it around to reconstruct stateful PGS lines after seeks, fast-forwards, and audio switches. Eleven rounds of fixes hardened that model and it still regressed on index-starved remote sources (recovery north of 20 s). The producer now keeps every embedded subtitle stream it already demuxes and feeds them into `SubtitlePacketStore` (compressed retention, 300 s / 32 MB); a playhead-paced drainer decodes cues from the store at the playhead, running the same stale-arrival gate, successor trim, and retention rules as before. The software host feeds the store through its own tap. The side readers, their reuse pool, re-arm coalescing, condemned latch, and the cross-thread read-abort chain are deleted (~1350 lines); the native text-rendition readers (iOS WebVTT prefetch for PiP / AirPlay) remain. No extra connections, no reconstruction seeks: post-seek recovery is bounded by decode speed, not remote I/O. Includes the drainer forwarding cue-less PGS clear events so lines drop during silence, and the backscan running through the gate's reconstruction admission. One caveat carries over by design: a forward jump into never-watched, sparse-dialogue territory can still show a brief gap until the next composition, the same as mpv / VLC. Supersedes the interim per-seek reconstruction rounds that lived only between 4.12.1 and this release.

### Added

- **Buffered position for host scrub bars (#33).** `bufferedPosition` reports the disk cache's contiguous read-ahead frontier on the playlist axis for native direct play, so hosts can draw a buffered band ahead of the playhead.
- **Interlaced live TV: software deinterlace + DVB teletext (#107).** Interlaced H.264 routes to the software path with bwdif deinterlacing, and DVB teletext decodes through libzvbi into WebVTT cues. FFmpegBuild 1.0.5.
- **Cache-backed VOD scrub stills (#106).** Single-connection VOD sources render scrub thumbnails from the segment cache, the VOD twin of the live-TV path, instead of opening a second origin connection.
- **Remote-HLS audio tap delivery (#95).** `installAudioTap()` now delivers on the remote-HLS path (VOD and live): rendition/variant resolver, segment fetch + decrypt, self-contained TS/fMP4 decode, a playhead-follow reader, a monotonic gate trimming seam overlaps, and `audioTapHasDeliverySource` for host fail-loud. `aetherctl audiotap --remote` drives it.
- **Subtitle-preserving reduced-master fallback (#98).** Display-rejection fallback now stages master to reduced to media: the served reduced master keeps HDR and the subtitle renditions instead of dropping straight to a bare media playlist. `nativeSubtitleRenditionsServed` is published for the host external-subtitle window.
- **`SubtitleImage.canvasSize` (#112).** Bitmap cues carry their composition canvas size so hosts can map them onto the rendered video rect (defaulted parameter, source-compatible).
- **Stats surface.** Declared source video bitrate (with Matroska `BPS` fallback), nominal frame rate, audio bitrate, and bridge output are published for host stats overlays.

### Fixed

- **Multi-clip / multi-title Blu-ray timeline (#105).** Fold multi-clip titles on observed clip bases rather than MPLS inTime, rebase the playhead onto the 0-based display axis, defeat repeated-clip decoy playlists in title selection, trust the MPLS title duration, and follow the selected title for stills.
- **DV P5 still tone-map (#103).** The DV P5 still converter matches libplacebo's BT.2390 tone-map and applies the RPU reshaping curves.
- **Backward-scrub cold read reconnects fast (#93, #96).** The detour fetch a starved backward scrub rides is bounded to a ~4 s budget instead of waiting out the 15/35 s socket timeouts, and `markClosed` cancels the persistent connection.
- **Stall-recovery nudge reads the rendered frame (#115).** The stalled-consumer nudge re-reads the position at nudge time instead of reusing the pre-grace wedge capture, which skipped VOD playback backward on re-engage.
- **AVAudioSession hang-risk diagnostic from the engine constructor (#114).** `AetherEngine.init()` runs on the main actor, so its `setCategory(.playback, ...)` / `setSupportsMultichannelContent(true)` pair, both XPC round-trips to mediaserverd, executed on the main thread. The category is now declared on a detached task; every load path awaits it before the first activation, preserving issue #24's "declare early, never activate at init" contract.
- **Cold DV/HDR master start gates on real track readiness (#35),** falling back to media when the tracks never materialize, and the #65 backpressure wedge detector is suspended until the first rendered frame so a slow DV-master pre-roll is not treated as a wedge.
- **Scrub clock held through a wedged-restart recovery (#37 resurface, #93).**
- **Resolved content lengths shared across demuxer opens (#112).** `SourceContentLengthCache` lets an open whose size probe was starved under concurrent load (or 429'd) reuse an already-resolved length for the same origin and stay byte-seekable; a genuinely length-less source never populates the cache.
- **Synthetic PGS END flush gated on a complete object (#112),** clearing the "Invalid object id 0" decode noise on split m2ts.
- **Native legible renditions (Sodalite#38).** Host-managed native renditions never emit `FORCED=YES`, and the native legible selection stays deselected in fullscreen until the host explicitly selects it. The deselect is pinned unconditionally the moment the legible group loads and re-asserted on a 40 ms cadence for the first second, so a system caption preference no longer flashes cues for up to ~0.5 s at video start on iOS.
- **Wired HDMI external display keeps loopback + master (Sodalite#34).**

## [4.12.1] - 2026-07-05

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.12.1))

### Fixed

- **mov_text subtitle OOM on the host overlay (#104 follow-up).** 4.12.0 added the video/audio discard to the native PiP/AirPlay subtitle rendition path only. The tvOS host-overlay reader is a different side demuxer and still lacked the discard, so selecting an embedded text subtitle streamed the whole video and audio through a second connection just to reach the sparse subtitle samples, RSS climbing with playback position until jetsam (worst on files with many subtitle tracks). The overlay side demuxer now discards everything except the selected subtitle stream, so it fast-walks the index between cues with no video/audio I/O.

## [4.12.0] - 2026-07-05

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.12.0))

### Added

- **Opt-in decoded PCM audio tap (#95).** `installAudioTap()` streams playback audio as mono Float32 48 kHz `AVAudioPCMBuffer`s with source-PTS timestamps and discontinuity flags, for host-side speech/audio features (live transcription, ShazamKit). Native path decodes the engine's own loopback segments near the playhead (zero extra network, follows the active track, cannot stall playback); software path mirrors the existing PCM decode. New `aetherctl audiotap` verification command.
- **Configurable forward-buffer window (#102).** `LoadOptions.forwardBufferSegments` sets how many segments the native path buffers ahead (clamped 4...150); nil keeps the adaptive default, letting hosts trade memory for resilience on slow or unstable sources.
- **Dolby Vision profile exposed for stats (#103).** `SourceProbe.dvProfile` and the live `sourceDVProfile` publish the source's DV profile number (5 / 7 / 8 / 10), so hosts can label "Dolby Vision P5" without a separate probe.
- **CEA-608 as a native WebVTT rendition on iOS (#98).** Decoded 608 captions are bridged into the native rendition machinery, so they survive PiP and AirPlay through the existing WebVTT path.

### Fixed

- **Stall recovery lands at the requested seek target (#93 retest).** A user seek that wedges never lands, so the frozen AVPlayer clock still reports the pre-seek position (#37 semantics); the recovery chain then nudged and reloaded at that frozen position, silently losing the seek (user seeks to 341.9 s, recovery resumes at 391.9 s). The unlanded seek target now survives the wedge as recovery intent: the nudge and the stage-2 item reload aim at it. The intent retires when the seek lands (rendered output reaches the target's neighbourhood), when playback resumes elsewhere (AVPlayer abandoned the seek; a later unrelated stall must not teleport to a stale target), and on load reset / stop.

- **Single-digit wedge detection once the producer parks (#93 retest).** The VOD backpressure wedge was detected by a 24 s frozen-fetch-target counter alone, putting recovery latency at 30-70 s (reporter timings). The detector now has a fast path keyed on the signal pair the reporter's trace isolated: producer parked while the consumer's fetch target AND rendered clock are both frozen with intact play intent. Both frozen for 5 s breaks the park immediately; healthy steady-state playback (the clock advances between segment fetches) and post-seek decode ramps (clock flat but prefetch keeps advancing the target) never trip it. The 24 s counter remains as fallback when no clock signal is wired.

- **Producer re-anchor aims at the requested seek target too (#93 retest).** Both producer re-anchor sites (the seek-deadline reconcile and the wedge break) re-anchored at the frozen rendered position even while an unlanded user seek was pending, pulling the producer away from the target window its own seek restart had just anchored; the wrong-window refill could also evict the target's segments from retention (a follow-on cache-miss stall shape). All recovery stages, producer re-anchor, consumer nudge, and stage-2 reload, now share one anchor decision: pending seek target first, frozen position only when none is pending.

- **Dolby Vision Profile 5 / AV1 Profile 10.0 thumbnail colour (#103).** `FrameExtractor` software-decoded the IPT-PQ-C2 base layer and read its planes as BT.2020 YCbCr, producing a green / magenta cast. It now applies the Dolby Vision colour transform from the RPU metadata (the IPT-PQ matrices + PQ EOTF, then a Hable tone-map to SDR) on the CPU; no Apple still-image API (AVAssetImageGenerator, QuickLook) resolves this on its own, since the reshape runs only in the live display compositor. Playback was never affected. The per-frame reshaping curves are intentionally skipped, validated against a libplacebo reference render as not driving the visible corruption.
- **mov_text subtitle memory growth (#104).** The native subtitle side demuxer lacked `discardAllStreamsExcept`, so it streamed the whole video + audio program through a second reader just to harvest sparse mov_text packets; RSS scaled with playback position and freed on deselect. It now discards the non-subtitle streams before packet allocation.
- **Bridged-resume alignment and post-EOF revive (#99).** Bridge PTS rebase, post-EOF encoder rebuild, and a bounded VOD muxer-failed revive.
- **PGS catch-up burst suppression (#100).** Stale PGS arrivals are held for successor resolution instead of flashing on screen.
- **Reactive master to media fallback on display rejection (#98).** Routing falls back from a master to a media playlist when the display rejects the advertised codec; the obsolete P5 always-media-direct guard was dropped now that the engine emits a well-formed `dvh1.05` master.
- **macOS on-demand HDR master routing (#98).** macOS built-in panels count as engage-on-demand for HDR masters.
- **Bounded wedge-restart reopen (#93 residual latency).** The wedge-restart reopen is bounded to a finite byte range, cutting residual restart latency.

### Changed

- **SMB uses SMBClient (#97).** The NWConnection-based `SMBClient` replaces AMSMB2, so SMB shares work on tvOS / iOS (AMSMB2 hit EPERM). Support boundary is SMB 2.0.2 / 2.1.

### Removed

- **Dead in-band mov_text / tx3g subtitle muxing.** Native subtitles ship as a separate WebVTT rendition; the unused in-band muxing path was removed.

## [4.11.0] - 2026-07-03

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.11.0))

### Fixed

- **Post-recovery video judder (#93 residual).** The wedged-restart fresh reopen skipped `avformat_find_stream_info` entirely, so the reopened demuxer never resolved the video stream's B-frame reorder depth (`video_delay` stayed 0) and delivered matroska B-frame packets with NOPTS or presentation-ordered, non-monotonic dts. The producer's dts repair then telescoped sample durations or dropped every reordered frame it could not bump past the `dts <= pts` muxer invariant, so every region produced after a wedge recovery played with heavy sustained video judder while stream-copied audio stayed clean. The reopen now keeps `find_stream_info` under a bounded probe budget (4 MB / 5 s), which resolves the reorder depth from the first packets at a small bounded read cost.

- **Subtitle readers follow AVKit-side seeks (#93 residual).** PiP's skip buttons seek the AVPlayer directly and never pass through the engine's seek API, so the native subtitle readers kept reading forward from the old region after a far PiP skip; AVKit's selection burst then fetched empty `.vtt` windows for the new region and cached them permanently, leaving the PiP rendition blank until a fresh selection. A far rendered-time jump now schedules a debounced re-anchor: once the skip storm settles, readers outside the playhead's coverage restart at the new position and the remembered rendition selection replays, whose deselect/reselect busts the cached empty windows. The whole-program eager reader is left alone.

- **PiP survives the stage-2 recovery reload (#93 residual).** The reload's default item teardown paused the player and dropped the current item to nil before the fresh one existed; during Picture in Picture that nil-item gap invalidated AVKit's content source (the PiP window was dismissed shortly after an in-PiP recovery, leaving audio-only background playback) and the transport bounce burned the spurious-pause re-assert budget within milliseconds. The recovery reload now swaps items atomically (`inPlaceSwap`): observers are rewired, but transport intent, clocks and the old item stay alive until `replaceCurrentItem` hands AVPlayer the fresh one. Episode-switch reloads keep the pause-before-swap path (#15 waitForSwitch).

- **Pre-first-frame loader death now recovers (#93 startup).** A CoreMedia -15628 before playback ever started never posts `playbackStalled`, so the dead-consumer watchdog never armed and the session sat in an endless spinner (producer parking and re-anchoring forever). The -15628 errorLog now surfaces as a stall signal (the watchdog's fetches-frozen / waitingToPlay / item-healthy guards drop survivable transients), and the backpressure-wedge re-anchor path arms its own stage-2 item-reload escalation when the consumer stays silent after the nudge. The extractor yield gate also gained hysteresis: it opens only after several consecutive healthy 1 Hz buffer ticks, because a single post-load spike above the floor let a multi-megabyte warm pull through the exact window that killed the loader.

- **Active subtitles survive the stage-2 recovery reload (#93 residual).** The dead-loader item reload swaps AVPlayerItems, and legible selection is per-item, so an active native subtitle rendition silently disappeared (worst in PiP, where the rendition is the only subtitle path). The engine now remembers the host's last `setNativeSubtitleSelected` request and replays it onto the fresh item; a deselect clears the memory so a reload never resurrects subtitles the user turned off.

- **Session-coupled still extraction yields to a starved pipeline (#93 startup).** The scrub-preview warm-seed / chapter-thumbnail extraction opens its own demuxer and pulls megabytes over the same link the segment producer needs; at playback start on a marginal link that contention tipped the first segment past CoreMedia's ~4 s media timeout, the AVPlayer loader died (-15628) and the session played 1-2 s, stalled, and needed the stage-2 item reload. Extractors vended by `makeFrameExtractor()` (and the new `makeFrameExtractor(url:httpHeaders:)` overload for host-chosen still URLs, e.g. originals during a transcode) now yield elective thumbnail decodes while a producer restart is in flight or the consumer's forward buffer is under 3 s; snapshots and cache hits are never gated, and standalone `FrameExtractor(url:)` instances are unaffected.

### Added

- **`aetherctl pktdump`.** Raw video packet timing (dts / pts / duration, NOPTS and monotonicity stats, delta histograms) as delivered by the demuxer under a selectable open profile (`--profile playback|restartReopen|stillExtraction`). The differential between profiles is what isolated the #93 judder root cause; backed by the public `PacketTimingProbe`.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-07-02

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.10.0))

### Added

- **External subtitles as first-class tracks (#88).** External subtitle files register with the engine (`LoadOptions.externalSubtitles` at load, `addExternalSubtitleTrack` any time) and appear in `subtitleTracks` with a synthetic id and `isExternal == true`, selectable through the unified `selectSubtitleTrack` (primary and secondary). Load-declared tracks join the native WebVTT renditions (subtitles in PiP / AirPlay) via a whole-file store fill, and a finished store backfills the fullscreen overlay instantly on select. `preferredSubtitleLanguages` ranks external tracks too; a track added mid-session auto-activates only while the host has made no explicit subtitle choice. `removeExternalSubtitleTrack` unregisters.

- **Resume-anchored first producer (#93).** The first producer anchors at the segment covering the load's start position instead of producing seg0 into an immediate teardown; the seg0/resume fetch race could previously 404 the item into a host reload (double spinner, audio over a black frame).

### Fixed

- A pump-tap-fed subtitle selection kept forwarding cues into the overlay after switching to a sidecar file (stale tap-overlay stream index).
- **iOS HDR/DV master routing.** The master-vs-media gate required a tvOS-style panel-in-HDR signal, so every HDR/DV film on iPhone routed media-direct and PiP subtitles silently never worked for them; iOS now treats `AVPlayer.eligibleForHDRPlayback` as panel readiness.
- **Subtitle rendition names and selection.** Duplicate same-language rendition NAMEs collapsed AVFoundation's legible options, and the option matcher compared raw container tags against normalized language tags, selecting a wrong-language rendition in PiP. Names are unique now, forced tracks declare `FORCED=YES`, and matching goes through the ISO-synonym table with no cross-language fallback.
- **Backward-seek restart latency cluster (#93 residual).** The wedged-restart fresh reopen no longer re-pays the full first-open probe budget; waiting segment fetches ride an in-flight restart instead of burning fixed retry budgets into 503s; lazy native subtitle readers defer while a restart is executing instead of competing for the starved link. Fetch-fired restarts are now heavily guarded: a re-request for the index a restart just targeted waits for the fresh producer instead of tearing it down, an index the active producer's forward march covers never fires or backstops (a backstop re-fire killed a 75% complete capture on device), and a request superseded by a newer declared target (a skip-storm orphan AVPlayer has already abandoned) never fires at all.
- **Terminal stall self-recovery (#93 residual).** After a CoreMedia -15628 error AVPlayer's media loader can die silently: playbackStalled, then zero segment requests while waitingToPlay, and the item never fails, leaving an endless spinner only a manual back-out cleared. Every stall now arms a fetch-counter watchdog: a consumer still silent after a grace window gets a zero-tolerance nudge seek, and if the loader stays dead, an in-place item reload on the same host (AVKit, PiP, and Control Center survive; retention serves the reload instantly). A spurious `.paused` (rate 0, no wait reason, no user action) during recovery is re-asserted with play() instead of latched as a user pause, which previously suspended the producer's wedge breaker and parked the session forever.

## [4.9.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **tvOS build.** The segment-retention free-space clamp queried `volumeAvailableCapacityForImportantUsage`, which does not exist on tvOS; tvOS now uses the plain `volumeAvailableCapacity` key.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.9.1))

## [4.9.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Native WebVTT subtitle renditions: subtitles survive PiP, AirPlay, and external display (Sodalite#32, #55).** Opt-in via `LoadOptions.prepareNativeSubtitles`: every text subtitle track is served as a language-tagged HLS `SUBTITLES` rendition over the loopback master (windowed per-video-segment WebVTT), exposed through AVFoundation's legible `AVMediaSelection` group. Renditions ship `DEFAULT=NO,AUTOSELECT=NO` so a host overlay never double-renders; hosts select per surface via `setNativeSubtitleSelected(track:)`, which now re-asserts automatically when AVFoundation drops a selection made during a stall recovery. Replaces the earlier mov_text/tx3g in-stream approach (in-band timed text is not HLS-conformant).
- **Subtitle pump tap: embedded text cues harvested from the producer's own read.** The segment producer keeps the text subtitle streams in its keep-set and hands their packets to a session-level decode tap (generalizing the CEA-608 tap), filling the per-track cue stores at zero side-channel bandwidth with coverage equal to the produced region, across seeks and restarts. The host overlay is fed from the same stores, so enabling embedded text subtitles is instant even on remote sources (previously a side demuxer had to open, seek, and read over the link); ASS markup is preserved for the styled overlay and stripped for the WebVTT renditions.
- **Byte-budgeted VOD segment retention: seeks into watched content no longer restart the producer (#93, Sodalite#32).** `SegmentCache` now keeps already-produced segments beyond its hard sliding window resident under a byte budget (2 GiB, clamped to a quarter of the tmp volume's free capacity; farthest-from-target evicted first once it fills), so a backward seek into the retained span, and the forward march after it, is served from cache with zero producer teardowns. This removes the demuxer re-seek that could wedge AVPlayer on slow sources after a backward seek (#93) and is the structural groundwork for PiP subtitles surviving seeks, since a producer restart detaches AVKit's legible renderer mid-session (Sodalite#32). Live sessions keep window-only pruning.

### Fixed

- **A teardown no longer caches a partial segment (VOD).** Every pump exit adopted the in-flight segment, including restart teardowns, caching content shorter than the playlist's EXTINF under a full segment's index (video and audio ending at different interleave-drain points). With retention such a segment became replayable: seeking back played it with ~2 s of A/V desync. VOD now adopts the in-flight segment only on a natural EOF (the tail is legitimately short); every other exit discards it and the next request re-produces it full-length. Live keeps adopting (its playlist advertises actual durations).
- **A producer restart now continues the fMP4 media timeline instead of zero-basing it (Sodalite#32, #93).** Every restart allocates a fresh mp4 muxer, and movenc zero-based each instance's timeline, so a restart-produced segment carried `tfdt=0` while the VOD playlist placed it at its plan offset: an implicit timeline discontinuity on every seek-restart. AVPlayer papered over it for plain playback, but it detaches AVKit's legible renderer mid-PiP (Sodalite#32) and matches the playhead/loaded-range decoupling signature (#93). The muxer now sets `movflags +frag_discont` with `avoid_negative_ts=disabled` so `tfdt` carries the producer's absolute output timestamps, the restart audio gate inherits the session shift (video shift rescaled, as head-of-stream always did) instead of snapping audio onto the video seam and off the source frame grid, and leading head-of-stream audio that would map below zero is dropped. A restarted segment is now byte-identical to its continuously-produced twin modulo the per-muxer `mfhd` sequence number, pinned by a new witness test on a committed A/V fixture; the init segment stays byte-identical across restarts. Head-of-stream audio also no longer has its first frame artificially stretched to absorb the intrinsic A/V offset; the true offset lands in `tfdt`.
- **E-AC-3/AC-3/TrueHD no longer wedge the fragmented-mp4 muxer on an out-of-cache backward seek (#94).** Under `+delay_moov` the mp4 muxer writes `moov` lazily on the first flush, and for AC-3/E-AC-3/TrueHD the audio sample entry (`dac3`/`dec3`/`dmlp`) can only be built from a parsed audio packet — so a first `moov` flush that fires video-only errors `-22` ("Cannot write moov atom before EAC3 packets parsed"), the segment cut fails, and the fresh muxer the producer builds at a backward-seek restart is retried forever (AVPlayer 503 → forever-loading spinner). `MP4SegmentMuxer` now latches at init whether the audio codec needs a parsed packet and, scoped to those codecs only, guards the #64 RAM-cap interim flush and proactively primes `moov` with the first audio packet. AAC and every other codec keep the stock path (no early flush, full RAM-cap bound), so there is no audio-dropout regression.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Unified `playbackPhase` as the playback-status source of truth (#85).** A published `playbackPhase` enum replaces ad hoc status flags, with a typed `.stalled(reconnecting:)` case and a typed `onNetworkPhaseChanged` reader callback wired across the native, software, and audio hosts.
- **Software-path background audio on iOS.** Software-decode playback keeps audio alive when the app backgrounds, via a background-audio-only demux loop and a wedge-safe keepalive policy. Exercised by the new `aetherctl bgaudio` harness.
- **`aetherctl segverify`.** A deterministic, headless probe that decodes each loopback segment in isolation and reports whether it is independently decodable (the segment-independence ground truth used to verify #92).
- **`aetherctl --throttle-kbps`.** Slow-CDN simulation for `serve` / `segverify`, to reproduce backpressure and recovery behaviour under a bandwidth cap.

### Fixed

- **Open-GOP and B-frame VOD segments decode cleanly after a fresh decode (#92).** VOD segment cutting is now keyframe-gated in decode order (the IRAP opens its own segment, like the live path and FFmpeg's hls muxer), so a rebuffer or seek landing on a segment boundary no longer starts mid-GOP with a decode dependency on its predecessor. This removes the transient blocky corruption on reordered content.
- **A bunched keyframe index that spans under one segment is rejected (#91).** Such an index passed the gap check but produced a single whole-file segment that AVPlayer rejected with no tracks; the planner now also requires the index to span at least one target segment, else it falls back to a uniform plan.
- **No black flash on a software-path seek (#90).** The software path holds the last displayed frame across a seek instead of blanking the display before the post-seek keyframe.
- **No audio crackle on software-decode playback (#89).** Software-decode audio buffers are stamped from a gapless running sample clock, fixing a per-frame click on frames that do not land on integer-millisecond boundaries.
- **No multi-second startup stall on remote PGS subtitles (#87).** The subtitle side demuxer skips `find_stream_info` and reads the codec from the header or PMT, with a bounded fallback, removing the blocking probe at load.
- **Correct HDR and Dolby Vision format label in Stats for Nerds on iOS.**

## [4.7.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **AirPlay (#86).** The in-process loopback HLS is served over the device's active LAN IP with the media playlist forced while AirPlay external playback is active, so the receiver gets the engine-processed stream (Dolby Vision / Atmos / subtitles preserved) instead of a master it would reject.
- **iOS background playback.** A wedge-safe background keepalive policy plus a PiP and background-playback API for hosts, so native-path iOS playback survives backgrounding and Picture-in-Picture.
- **Experimental native WebVTT subtitles (gated).** A WebVTT `SUBTITLES` rendition served over the loopback so text subtitles can reach PiP / AirPlay via `AVMediaSelection`, opt-in behind `LoadOptions.prepareNativeSubtitles` and inert by default (reliable display through a custom-transport player is still open, #55).

## [4.6.3] — 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **A remote ISO no longer recognizes the disc twice at startup (#76).** The 4.6.2 cache stopped the per-switch re-open, but the reporter still saw the disc open twice before playback began. The probe demuxer opens the source with no explicit title (`selectTitleID == nil`) and caches the recognition under that key, while the rest of the engine references that same title by its resolved id (the default resolves to title index 0, and `DiscTitle.id == index`): background reloads and the subtitle side demuxer pass the concrete id, never nil. The side demuxer's first open therefore missed the probe's cache entry and re-ran the full UDF / `.mpls` parse, the second "disc tray" open before the first cue. `DiscReader.storeRecognition` now aliases the entry under the resolved selected index when it differs from the requested id, so the nil-probe recognition is hit by the concrete-id lookup. Disc recognition runs once per session; the subtitle side demuxer still attaches its own (probe-capped) demuxer for the bitmap-subtitle stream, which is decoded out-of-band from a separate context by design, but no longer re-recognizes the disc in front of it.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.6.3))

## [4.6.2] — 2026-06-27

### Changed

- **Subtitle and audio track switches on a remote ISO no longer re-open the source (#76).** Selecting a subtitle track, switching audio, or seeking re-opened a demuxer, and every open re-ran disc recognition: the UDF / ISO9660 directory parse plus a read of every `.mpls` (Blu-ray) or `.IFO` (DVD) over HTTP. On a disc with dozens of playlists that round-tripped many times per switch, which the reporter saw as the "disc tray" reopening on each subtitle change. Two changes remove it. (1) `DiscReader.wrap` now memoizes the parsed disc structure (title list + clip extents) per source URL and selected title, so a reopen rebuilds only the cheap concat reader and skips the directory re-parse; the main pump, the subtitle side demuxer, and the audio reload share one cache, so recognition runs once per session. (2) For URL sources the subtitle side demuxer is retained per source + title and reused across track switches and seeks: the open container is re-seeked to the new playhead and re-pointed at the new stream index, with no re-open or re-probe. A successor reader hands off from its predecessor before touching the shared demuxer, so they never read it concurrently. Custom sources (SMB) still open per switch but benefit from the recognition cache.

## [4.6.1] — 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **Hardened the 4.6.0 in-band CEA-608 closed-caption path (#77).** Two robustness fixes from post-merge review. (1) The `ClosedCaptionTap` decoded on the producer pump thread with no lock, on the assumption of a single pump. The restart path abandons an old pump after a 5 s join timeout (`HLSVideoEngine.performRestart`), so an abandoned pump can briefly overlap the new one calling into the same tap, racing the (not-thread-safe) `CEA608Decoder` and the cue buffer. The tap now guards its decode state with a lock, mirroring `NativeSubtitleCueStore` (#55); worst case during the rare overlap is a few garbled cues that self-correct on the next reset / EOC. (2) Seeking with closed captions active left the pre-seek caption on screen until the next caption decoded, because the CC seek path reset the tap but did not clear the mirrored cues. It now clears them immediately, symmetric with the side-demuxer subtitle path.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.6.1))

## [4.6.0] — 2026-06-27

### Added

- **In-band CEA-608 closed captions from a demuxable caption track, rendered through the host overlay (#77).** A source whose only caption track is an embedded CEA-608 stream (`eia_608`, e.g. a QuickTime/MP4 `c608` track) previously could not render: FFmpegBuild ships no `ccaption` decoder, so the side-demuxer `EmbeddedSubtitleDecoder` open failed and the track sat active-but-blank (`subActive=true / subCues=0`). The engine now reads that caption track's `cc_data` off the segment producer's existing source connection: a read-only observer keeps the `eia_608` stream in the demuxer's keep-set, hands each of its packets to an external `ClosedCaptionTap`, then drops it (never muxed → the loopback-HLS segment output is byte-identical to the no-CC path). An in-house CEA-608 decoder (pop-on / roll-up / paint-on, PAC row addressing, mid-row codes, and the basic / special / extended West-European character sets; odd-parity validation, doubled-control suppression and the character / PAC tables validated against FFmpeg's `ccaption_dec.c`) turns the bytes into cues published on the same `subtitleCues` host-overlay path as every other side-decoded subtitle codec. Because the tap owns the cue buffer and rides the producer (re-threaded onto every restart via `makeProducer`), captions appear instantly on enable (no second demuxer, no extra connection) and survive seek / reload / wedge. The native `mov_text` rendition (#55) is untouched: CC is excluded from that path (it can't become `tx3g`) and rendered through the overlay like the bitmap subtitle codecs, so (as with those) it is host-overlay only (no PiP / AirPlay CC). First cut: 608 field-1 / channel CC1; CEA-708 (DTVCC) and field 2 are follow-ons. Thanks to DrHurt for the externalise-subtitles steer.

## [4.5.7] — 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **On macOS the video image slid off-center during a live window resize, snapping back centered once the drag ended (#80).** The hosted video `CALayer` was added as a sublayer with no autoresizing mask, so its frame only caught up on the next `layout()` pass, a frame behind the continuously-changing view `bounds` during the drag. Because an `NSView`'s backing layer is anchored bottom-left, that one-pass lag read as the image drifting off-center while resizing. The layer now gets a flexible autoresizing mask (`[.layerWidthSizable, .layerHeightSizable]`) in the AppKit branch, so Core Animation stretches it in lockstep with the superlayer's bounds on every frame; initialized to full bounds, it starts and stays full-bounds (and centered) throughout. AppKit-only branch, so iOS/tvOS are untouched, and no effect on decode, timing, or audio. Reported by reckloon from a downstream consumer (Ocelot).

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.5.7))

## [4.5.6] — 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **A video file silently degraded to the audio-only backend when its open-time probe lost to a transient origin error (#78).** When the probe open hit a rate-limit (a 429 whose body parsed as `AVERROR_INVALIDDATA`), the engine logged `probe failed (...); proceeding without criteria` and then routed a 4K HEVC VOD to the audio-only path: audio played, no picture for the rest of the session, Live state showing `Backend audio, resolution 0x0`. Root cause was a conflation of "probe failed" with "file has no video": on probe failure `hasVideoStream` was false not because the file lacked video but because we never looked, and `shouldUseAudioOnlyPath` read that as no-video and dispatched `audio dispatch: codec=0 -> FFmpeg`. Once connections recovered the demux open enumerated `stream[0] type=video codec=hevc 3840x2160` (the audio-only decision was already locked in). The audio-only path is now reserved for an explicit `audioOnly` request or a *successful* probe that genuinely found no video. A failed probe on a non-audioOnly URL source falls through to the native video path (custom and live sources already fail-fast on a failed probe), so `HLSVideoEngine` reopens the source and discovers the stream. Reported by the AetherPlayer community.

## [4.5.5] — 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **Selecting an embedded subtitle on a network ISO (Blu-ray / DVD over http) never showed cues, while the same disc worked from a local ISO (#76).** The embedded subtitle side-demuxer logged `embedded subtitle reader exited (cancelled=true) packetsRead=0`: it was superseded by a seek / title switch / re-select before it read a single packet. The open was glacially slow on a remote disc. It re-opened with the full 50 MB / 60 s probe, and the disc's sparse `hdmv_pgs_subtitle` streams never resolve codec parameters, so `find_stream_info` read to the full 50 MB over http chasing them (the #75 pattern). It then ran the MKV cue-index prewarm seek (`duration × 0.5`), a cold range read to the middle of a 32 GB ISO that buys nothing for a concat MPEG-TS / VOB disc. Together the open ran tens of seconds; locally both are instant, so it only failed over http. `EmbeddedSubtitleDecoder` needs only codec id / type (carried in the container header / MPEG-TS PMT and resolved by the open itself) and seeds bitmap canvas dims from the source video size, so the full chase is pure cost. The side-demuxer now caps its probe to 4 MB / 5 s (honouring an even tighter caller budget), skips the cue-index prewarm seek for disc sources, and opens the same BD/DVD title the user is watching rather than always title 0. Applied to both the inline reader and the native multi-decode (#55) reader. Reported by the AetherPlayer community.

## [4.5.4] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Resuming or seeking into a wide-interleave progressive MP4 desynced audio ~1 s ahead of video (#74 follow-up).** The 4.5.1 fix buffered pre-video-gate audio only at head-of-stream, so first-frame playback is in sync, but a mid-file seek/resume on a source that muxes audio ahead of video in file order still drifted. On a restart the demuxer lands before the video keyframe and scans forward to it; the audio that matches the keyframe is muxed earlier in the file, so it is read during that scan while the audio gate is still closed and was dropped. The post-gate restart-target filter then snapped the next (~1 s-later) audio onto the keyframe, putting audio ahead of picture (reporter trace: `audio gate open: actual=44112896 target=44064064 gapMs=1017.3`). The producer now buffers pre-gate audio on a VOD restart as well, not just head-of-stream, so the same restart-target filter selects the matching packet from the `[target, …]` window and the gate opens at `gapMs ≈ 0`. Live restart keeps the original drop (its program-boundary re-anchor handles audio separately); the buffer stays bounded by the existing 8 MB cap, and normal-interleave seeks are unaffected. Reported and root-caused by reckloon.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.5.4))

## [4.5.3] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **A rapid scrub burst could leave the loopback-HLS VOD producer permanently anchored away from the playhead (#79).** The 4.2.2 seek-deadline recovery reconciles the engine clock to AVPlayer's real rendered position and re-anchors the segment producer there. Under a sustained bidirectional scrub burst on a bridged-audio title that re-anchor was routed through the burst-coalescing restart path (#35), where a later coalesced scrub target overwrote it, so the producer settled at the stale scrub position (~3914 s) while the clock sat at the rendered position (~5577 s), a ~1660 s gap AVPlayer could never close, leaving it starved with no recovery. The recovery re-anchor is now *authoritative*: computed from AVPlayer's real position, it wins the coalescer's pending slot over any in-flight scrub target (a newer authoritative re-anchor still supersedes an older one), so the producer ends where the clock was reconciled to. The backpressure wedge breaker uses the same authoritative path; live segment-loss reopen is unaffected. Separately, when a restart found the old producer wedged in a blocking network read on the shared demuxer (which `stop()` cannot interrupt), the new producer queued behind that read for the full ~20 s connection-stall timeout (a ~25 s restart). On the single-demuxer VOD path the engine now opens a fresh demuxer, aborts the wedged read, and hands the fresh demuxer to the new producer, which also frees the wedged reader's buffers promptly instead of after 20 s. Thanks to reckloon for the frame-exact trace and the root-cause analysis.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.5.3))

## [4.5.2] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **A user pause was misread as a backpressure wedge, deadlocking the loopback-HLS VOD path (#65).** The 4.2.2 wedge-breaker re-anchors the producer when the consumer's fetch target freezes. A paused AVPlayer freezes that target legitimately (it issues no forward fetch by design), so a pause longer than ~24 s on a bridged-audio loopback-HLS title (TrueHD, DTS-HD MA, or any codec that routes through the FLAC/EAC3 bridge) tripped the breaker. The re-anchor loop then ran against a player that cannot advance, exhausted its attempts, and left the producer re-anchored ahead of a buffer stranded behind the playhead, a state resume could not recover (force-quit required). Wedge detection now gates on play intent: it tracks `timeControlStatus` and suspends while the player is paused, so a pause of any length never trips it and the window after resume starts fresh. A genuine starved wedge (the player wants to play but is buffer-starved, `waitingToPlay`) still trips, and the seek-deadline reconcile gets the same pause guard so a paused scrub is not mistaken for a starved seek. Thanks to rrgomes and reckloon for the independent captures and the precise root-cause analysis.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.5.2))

## [4.5.1] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Head-of-stream audio muxed ahead of video was dropped, causing a constant ~1 s A/V desync (#74).** On the native loopback-HLS path the producer's audio gate dropped every audio packet that arrived before the first video packet. On a wide-interleave source (audio muxed ~1 s ahead of video in file order, e.g. a progressive MP4 whose leading second of AAC precedes the first video packet) that discarded the entire leading second of real audio, so AVPlayer pulled the survivors forward into a constant ~1 s lag (the same file stays in sync in VLC / Infuse). The producer now buffers that pre-gate audio (bounded by an 8 MB cap) and replays it in DTS order once the video gate opens, so it flows through the normal target-filter / anchor / write path. Scoped to head-of-stream; restart and seek producers keep the original drop, where the post-gate shift already anchors their surviving audio. Thanks to reckloon for the report and the corrected root-cause analysis.

- **An unresolvable cover-art stream made remote open read to the full probe budget (#75).** A remote MP4 carrying an embedded cover-art stream (mjpeg reported as 0x0) kept `avformat_find_stream_info` reading toward `probesize` (tens of MB pulled over the network) trying to resolve codec parameters that never resolve, even though the real H.264 + AAC streams were available almost immediately. Attached-picture streams are now reclassified to `AVMEDIA_TYPE_ATTACHMENT` before stream-info probing, so they resolve instantly and the probe stops once the real streams are known. Cover-art extraction is unaffected (it reads the attached picture plus the unchanged disposition). Thanks to reckloon for the report.

## [4.5.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Subtitle-language pick ranks by container disposition; `TrackInfo` surfaces forced / SDH / commentary (#73).** `LoadOptions.preferredSubtitleLanguages` (4.4.0) activated the first track in a matching language. It now activates the *best* track within the first matching preference: full subtitles rank over SDH (`HEARING_IMPAIRED`), forced, and commentary (`COMMENT`), and text over bitmap, all from container dispositions; preference order still dominates rank. New `TrackInfo.isForced` / `isHearingImpaired` / `isCommentary` (read alongside the existing `isDefault`) surface those dispositions for audio and subtitle tracks, so a host can rank or filter `subtitleTracks` the same way. The pure `selectSubtitleIndex`, `subtitlePickRank`, and `isBitmapSubtitleCodec` helpers are exposed and unit-tested.

### Fixed

- **Bitmap subtitles leaked into the native `mov_text` rendition (#55).** With `prepareNativeSubtitles` set, two sites matched `TrackInfo.codec` (the libavcodec *decoder* name, e.g. `pgssub`) against an exact-match set of *descriptor* names (`hdmv_pgs_subtitle`, `dvb_subtitle`, `dvd_subtitle`, `xsub`), so PGS / DVB / DVD bitmap tracks were not excluded (only `xsub` matched by coincidence). They leaked into the `mov_text` trak table and the native-store-attach set, producing phantom entries in the `AVMediaSelection` legible group and a store/reader index mismatch. Both sites now use a shared decoder-name `isBitmapSubtitleCodec` classifier that agrees with the reader's enum classifier, so only true text tracks become native `mov_text` traks.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.5.0))

## [4.4.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **First-frame subtitle selection by language preference (#73).** A host with a saved subtitle-language preference had to read the post-load `subtitleTracks` and language-match `selectSubtitleTrack` itself. New `LoadOptions.preferredSubtitleLanguages` (ordered; ISO 639-1 / 639-2 codes or English names, e.g. `["en", "de"]`; default empty) lets the engine activate the first subtitle track whose language matches a preference (preferences scanned in order, case-insensitive, ISO 639-1/2 B+T and English-name synonyms) at the end of a successful load, mirroring the audio twin (`preferredAudioLanguages`, #72). No match leaves subtitles off (the default). The host-overlay path is used (equivalent to a `selectSubtitleTrack` call), the resolved track is published via the new `activeSubtitleTrackIndex` (parity with `activeAudioTrackIndex` so a picker reflects it), and the side demuxer is anchored at the resume position (clamped to the probe duration) instead of byte 0. Unlike `preferredAudioLanguages` (whose track is muxed into the loopback HLS at the first frame, so a late pick forces a pre-probe or reload), this is pure convenience: subtitles are activated post-load by a side demuxer at no reload or pre-probe cost, so it only spares a host from language-matching `subtitleTracks` itself. Independent of `prepareNativeSubtitles`, whose default selection stays host-driven via `setNativeSubtitleSelected`. Empty preferences is a behavioral no-op, so nothing changes until a host opts in. The audio half of #73 already shipped in 4.3.0. Thanks to reckloon for the request.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.4.0))

## [4.3.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **First-frame audio selection by language preference (#72).** A host that wants a saved audio-language preference honored on the first frame previously had to open the source an extra time to pick the track (an audio pre-probe) or reload via `selectAudioTrack` after load. Each extra open re-runs `avformat_open_input` + `find_stream_info` + the size probe, multiplying pre-first-frame latency and request volume against a remote source. New `LoadOptions.preferredAudioLanguages` (ordered; ISO 639-1 / 639-2 codes or English names, e.g. `["en", "de"]`; default empty) lets the engine resolve the audio track from its single internal probe: an explicit `audioSourceStreamIndex` still wins, else the first track matching a preference in order (case-insensitive, ISO 639-1/2 B+T and English-name synonyms), else the container default. The resolved index drives the played audio on both the native and software paths. Empty preferences with no override is a behavioral no-op, so nothing changes until a host opts in; a probe-failed source still honors an explicit override verbatim. The engine already reuses its single probe demuxer as the session demuxer, so honoring the preference here removes the remaining redundant open for the prefer-a-language case. Thanks to reckloon for the request and the staged-reuse framing.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.3.0))

## [4.2.3] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Redundant open-time size probe on remote HTTP sources (#70).** `AVIOReader.open()` fired a dedicated `probeFileSize()` round-trip (a `Range: bytes=0-0` GET, falling back to HEAD) before opening the real data connection, even though that connection's own `Range: bytes=0-` request returns a 206 whose `Content-Range` already carries the total. On origins that omit a length for `bytes=0-0` the probe also paid a second HEAD round-trip, and that HEAD was the request some origins rate-limited (429), dropping an otherwise-fine source into seekless streaming mode. The playback path now derives the size from the first data connection's response (206 `Content-Range`, or `Content-Length` on a from-0 2xx), so the common case skips the probe entirely; live skips it too (its result was discarded anyway and it burned the Range timeout on transcode endpoints that reject Range). When the data connection resolves no size (a genuinely length-less origin, a transient 429, slow response headers, or a length only reachable via HEAD), the open falls back to the exact prior probe path on a separate connection and budget, so seekability is preserved whenever a size is reachable and only a truly length-less source streams. The size is now folded in under the connection's existing lock, and the remaining still-extraction probe switches `bytes=0-0` to `bytes=0-` for the same one-shot win. Thanks to reckloon for the diagnosis and the confirmed `bytes=0-` probe shape.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.2.3))

## [4.2.2] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Loopback-HLS VOD scrub-burst livelock (#65).** A sustained bidirectional scrub burst on the native (loopback-HLS) direct-play path could deadlock playback: the engine clock latched at an optimistic seek target AVPlayer never physically reached, while the segment producer parked on backpressure with no VOD watchdog. The two halves waited on each other with no recovery floor, so the picture froze 30 to 40 seconds behind the reported clock and never recovered. Two coupled fixes give the path a recovery floor. The native VOD seek await is now bounded by a cadence budget: when a seek does not land and AVPlayer is genuinely starved (no forward buffer), the engine reconciles its clock to AVPlayer's real rendered position instead of the unreachable target and re-anchors the producer there, while a slow-but-buffering seek still awaits its real landing unchanged. And the VOD backpressure park now has the watchdog the live paths always had: a consumer fetch target frozen past a threshold breaks the park and re-anchors the producer on AVPlayer's real position (a slow-but-advancing consumer never trips it, and a storm guard bounds re-anchors if AVPlayer never resumes). Thanks to rrgomes for the frame-exact trace that pinned the root cause.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.2.2))

## [4.2.1] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Persistent AVIOReader reconnect storm on a non-faststart / coarsely-interleaved remote MP4 (#69).** A remote MP4 with a trailing `moov` and track data tens of MB apart makes the demuxer ping-pong across distant file regions during `avformat_find_stream_info` / index parse. The persistent reader used to tear down and reopen its HTTP connection on every such non-sequential read, so the parse storm drove the origin into a 429 and playback never started. Those random-access reads now go through the existing pooled keep-alive session, cached as 4 MB aligned blocks in a small LRU (8 blocks, roughly 32 MB, VOD-only), so the streaming connection stays anchored and the storm collapses to the two legitimate reconnects (open plus the one seek to the moov). The sequential playback fast path never enters the cache, so it carries no overhead; only full-length blocks are cached, so a truncated range response cannot shadow the re-fetch of its uncovered tail; and once detour reads turn sequential past 8 MB the streaming connection re-anchors there, returning steady playback (and large backward scrubs) to the cheap sliding-window path. Thanks to reckloon for the detailed diagnosis and the validated detour-cache design.
- **Reconnect loop under a sustained 429 (#71).** When an origin rate-limited essentially every request, the reader looped reconnecting (gen=N climbing) instead of failing cleanly: a 429 carried no `Retry-After` so the backoff was zero, and the random-access parse seeks kept resetting the unproductive-reconnect streak before it reached the give-up cap. A 429/503 now drives a separate rate-limit streak that the seek-driven reconnects do not reset and that only real read progress clears, so a throttled origin gives up cleanly after a bounded number of attempts, with exponential backoff that grows even when no `Retry-After` is present. The detour cache's miss-under-429 fallback backs off in place and retries the pooled fetch rather than opening a fresh connection, so it cannot re-enter the churn the cache removes.

## [4.2.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Caller-bounded demux probe budget per `load()` (#68).** A large remote remux with sparse streams (HDMV PGS subtitles, an mjpeg cover attachment) makes `avformat_find_stream_info` read to the full internal probe budget (50 MB / 60 s) on every open, costing roughly 13-14 s before the first frame over a slow CDN even though the video and audio streams resolve almost immediately. That budget is tuned for local disk, where reading 50 MB is free, and a remote caller had no way to cap it. Two optional `LoadOptions` fields now let a caller cap the open-time probe, both defaulting to `nil` so nothing changes unless set: `probesize` (bytes, maps to `AVFormatContext.probesize`) and `maxAnalyzeDuration` (microseconds, maps to `AVFormatContext.max_analyze_duration`). The cap is applied to every main-playback open that runs `find_stream_info` (the routing probe that becomes the session demuxer, the software and audio fallback opens, the audio/title-switch reopens so a switch does not re-incur the cost, and the native HLS fallback open and live reopen) and only to those: the subtitle side-demuxer, the routing `probe(url:)` API, the Dolby Vision probe, still extraction, and the live companion-audio demuxer all keep the full budget because a complete probe is load-bearing there (sparse PGS / DVB track detection). An over-tight budget fails open (a late-resolving track is silently missing), not closed; `maxAnalyzeDuration: 0` is FFmpeg's shorter heuristic, not "no cap". Both trade-offs are documented on the fields. Internally, `DemuxerOpenProfile.withProbeBudget(probesize:maxAnalyzeDuration:)` overrides only the two probe knobs and leaves the AVIO tuning untouched.

## [4.1.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Disc title and chapter selection for DVD-Video and Blu-ray (#67).** A disc image now exposes every selectable title and the chapters of the playing title, and the host can switch between them. `engine.discTitles` lists the titles (Blu-ray playlists / DVD title sets, longest first so id 0 is the main feature) with each one's duration and chapter count; `engine.selectedDiscTitle` is the active one; `engine.selectTitle(id:)` switches title, rebuilding from the new title's head (the selection survives audio-track switches and background resume, and a fresh `load` defaults to the main title). `engine.discChapters` carries the selected title's chapters and `engine.selectChapter(id:)` seeks to one (a thin seek, no pipeline rebuild). Blu-ray titles and chapters come from the MPLS playlists and their PlayListMark entries; DVD titles, durations, and chapters come from the VMGI TT_SRPT and each title set's program chain (whole-VTS resolution, per-cell / episodic splitting deferred). Chapter starts are title-relative and `selectChapter` rebases them onto the playback clock (the native playlist shift, or the software path's container start PTS) so the seek lands. A new `discTitleID` parameter on `load` opens a disc straight to a chosen title, and `aetherctl disc-inspect` prints the full title + chapter list for a local image.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.1.0))

## [4.0.7] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Remote disc images (ISO 9660 / UDF / Blu-ray BDMV) over HTTP(S) (#64).** A local `.iso` is routed through the disc adapter, but the HTTP open path fed the source straight to libavformat, which fails to probe a disc image (it is a filesystem, not a media container) and returned an error, so network ISO playback never worked. New `HTTPDiscIOReader` is a seekable reader over an http(s) disc image using byte-range requests (the remote twin of the local file reader): it probes total size and range support up front and serves reads from an adaptive sliding read-ahead window (small for the scattered disc-structure reads at open, growing while playback stays sequential), with per-request retry/backoff so a transient blip does not end playback. `openHTTP` now routes a disc-image URL (`.iso` / `.img` / `.udf`) through the disc adapter exactly like the local path, and falls back to the streaming reader when the source is not a recognizable disc (so a mislabeled `.iso` still plays). The server must support byte ranges; if it does not, the reader logs why and falls back. Gated on the extension so normal media URLs keep the optimized streaming open with no probe cost.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.0.7))

## [4.0.6] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **DTS-HD Master Audio on a Blu-ray (MPEG-TS / M2TS) played silent (#64).** The bundled FFmpeg build (FFmpegBuild) enables a minimal parser allow-list, and it was missing the `dca` parser. On a byte-stream container the demuxer needs a codec's parser to assemble a complete frame; without `dca`, the MPEG-TS demuxer handed the decoder the DTS core (`0x7FFE8001`) and the following DTS-HD extension substream (`0x64582025`) as two separate packets, so every extension frame was rejected with "Residual encoded channels are present without core" and the track was silent. Matroska was unaffected because its blocks are already whole frames (only the `.m2ts` path was silent), which is why the same disc remuxed to MKV, or its audio extracted with `ffmpeg -c copy`, decoded fine. Fixed by bumping to FFmpegBuild 1.0.3, which enables `dca` and, in the same pass, the other parsers missing for already-bundled decoders: `mlp` (TrueHD/MLP), `vc1` (VC-1 video), and `dvbsub` / `dvdsub` (DVB and DVD bitmap subtitles), so the same framing class cannot bite TrueHD or VC-1 on M2TS either. No engine code change.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.0.6))

## [4.0.5] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **A Blu-ray whose content starts late played nothing until you seeked past the start (#64 follow-up).** The 4.0.4 disk-fill fix routes a sparse MPEG-TS keyframe index to the uniform-stride segment plan, but that plan anchored its source-axis boundaries at PTS 0. On a title whose first keyframe is well after zero (one real disc starts at 11.6s) the leading segments covered source time that has no frames, so the producer never emitted them while the playlist still advertised them, and the player's first-segment fetch was permanently out of range (it just kept restarting the producer). Playback only worked after seeking past the content start. The uniform plan now anchors its boundaries at the first keyframe (falling back to the video stream start time), exactly like the keyframe-aligned plan, so segment 0 begins at the content start. No public API change.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.0.5))

## [4.0.4] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **A Blu-ray (MPEG-TS / M2TS) source could fill the device disk and play neither video nor audio (#64).** MPEG-TS carries no upfront keyframe table the way Matroska Cues or MP4 `stss` do, so the VOD segment planner only saw the handful of keyframes that `avformat_find_stream_info` plus the mid-file prewarm seek happened to index (on a long title: one near the start, a cluster near the seek point). The keyframe-aligned planner trusted that sparse, clustered list whenever it had at least two entries and built a degenerate plan whose first segment spanned the whole gap (a 110 minute title produced a single ~3288 second segment). The fragmented-MP4 muxer runs with `+frag_custom`, so it emits a fragment only at an explicit segment cut; with one enormous segment it buffered nearly the entire title in libavformat's interleaver before any flush, which grew to multiple gigabytes that the device compressed and swapped until the disk filled, and `+delay_moov` kept `init.mp4` empty until that first flush so the player got no video either. Two fixes, both engine-internal: (1) the planner now rejects a keyframe index whose largest inter-keyframe gap exceeds `max(targetSegmentDuration * 4, 30)` seconds and falls back to the uniform-stride plan (regular ~4 second segments); (2) the muxer now caps how much it buffers within any one segment, force-flushing a fragment into the current file once the buffered video span exceeds ~2 segment durations (the same drain the cut uses, without rotating the file), which bounds memory on any long segment regardless of plan shape and also populates `init.mp4` promptly so video starts. No public API change.

### Known limitations

- On the same disc, the default DTS-HD Master Audio track decodes to no audio: its frames code the lossless extension as a residual on top of the core, which libavcodec's DCA decoder cannot reconstruct, so the bridge skips them. The fix above restores video; selecting one of the disc's AC3 tracks gives audio. The DTS-HD MA case is tracked separately.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.0.4))

## [4.0.3] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Enabling subtitles could freeze or badly slow the scrub-preview (trickplay) thumbnails (#27).** On-device scrub thumbnails are produced by an independent still-extraction pipeline that opens its own connection to the source and runs on a single serial decode queue. Its remote-source chunk read could park on a flat ~35s timeout with no way to cancel it, so a single stalled read froze the queue and pinned the preview on one frame while further scrubs queued behind it. Turning subtitles on is what triggered it: that spins up a third reader (the subtitle side-demuxer, opened with the persistent playback profile and a 90s read-ahead) which competes with the thumbnail reader for the source's bandwidth and the device's cores, lengthening the cold reads into the park; with subtitles off the reads return promptly and the preview tracks the scrub. Interlaced 480p MPEG-2 made it worse because that codec is software-decoded, so playback already held the cores. The still-extraction reader now aborts an in-flight fetch within ~100ms when a scrub supersedes it (or on teardown), bounds each decode with a short read deadline, fails fast (one retry instead of three across two URLs), and the thumbnail decoder is capped to two threads at `.utility` QoS so it can no longer starve the real-time software playback decode. Engine-internal change; no public API change. The playback and live read paths are untouched.

- **Dead live remote-HLS streams froze silently instead of retuning.** When a live IPTV/HLS source stopped delivering segments (segment 404s or an expired auth token), the native player's `failedToPlayToEnd` was only logged and the item stayed `readyToPlay`, so no terminal error reached the host and the automatic live retune never fired (the picture just froze). Remote-HLS `failedToPlayToEnd` is now routed through deferred-confirmation into a terminal error (gated to remote-HLS live only), so the host's live retune kicks in.

### Diagnostics

- Added a positive content-vs-clock ledger and a VOD backpressure-wedge probe to keep instrumenting the #65 post-seek-burst frame-drift investigation.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.0.3))

## [4.0.2] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **DTS-HD Master Audio lost its lossless XLL extension in FLAC bridge mode (#66).** The 4.0.1 fix routed every DTS source through the `dca_core` bitstream filter, stripping each packet to its lossy DTS core before the decoder. For DTS-HD MA streams that decode the full lossless XLL cleanly, that downgraded `.lossless` (FLAC) output to lossy 5.1, audible for hosts bridging to a multichannel-LPCM AVR. The bridge now decodes the full stream again (DTS-HD MA reconstructs the lossless XLL as S32P, re-encoded bit-perfectly to FLAC), and keeps the per-packet `EINVAL` skip that handles the rare residual-XLL-without-core frame (#64). It also re-derives the resampler input format from each decoded frame (the canonical libswresample contract, matching the software audio decoder), so a stream whose `sample_fmt` was unresolved at decoder open, or a bailed live probe, can no longer misread the decoded samples as the seed format. The `dca_core` filter is simply no longer used; no FFmpegBuild change is required.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.0.2))

## [4.0.1] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **DTS-HD Master Audio still failed to bridge after the 3.13.4 core-only attempt (#64).** 3.13.4 opened the `dca` decoder with `core_only=1` to skip the lossless XLL extension, but on Blu-ray the DTS core is carried as an asset inside the extension substream (EXSS), not as a standalone core sync, so `core_only` made libavcodec report "No valid DCA sub-stream found" and emit no audio (it even printed "Consider disabling 'core_only'"). The bridge now runs DTS through the `dca_core` bitstream filter, which strips each DTS-HD (MA / HRA) packet to its mandatory core at the bitstream level, so the decoder only ever sees full-rate 5.1/7.1 core PCM and never attempts the XLL reconstruction that residual-codes channels without a usable core. Falls back gracefully to the full decode path (with single-packet EINVAL skipping) if a build lacks the filter. Requires FFmpegBuild 1.0.2 (which enables `dca_core`).

## [4.0.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added

- **End-of-media is now surfaced to hosts as `PlaybackState.ended` (#63).** Each playback host already tracked `didReachEnd`, but the engine consumed it internally and collapsed the public surface to `.idle`, indistinguishable from pre-load or `stop()`. Hosts that want end-of-playback behavior (mark-watched, autoplay-next, dismiss) could only work around it on the native path by observing the handed-out `AVPlayer` for `AVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTime`; on the software-decode path there is no public `AVPlayer`, so there was no recourse at all. The engine now has a dedicated terminal state, `PlaybackState.ended`, set on end-of-media across every backend (native / software / audio); `stop()` still goes to `.idle`. `.ended` is terminal: `seek` / `togglePlayPause` are no-ops, and the next `load(...)` clears it.

### Breaking

- **`PlaybackState` gains a `.ended` case.** Adding a case to a (non-frozen) public enum is source-breaking: an exhaustive `switch` over `PlaybackState` that lacks an `@unknown default` no longer compiles until it handles `case .ended`. This is the only breaking change in 4.0.0 and the reason for the major bump; it ships as a major precisely so `from:`-pinned adopters opt into it deliberately rather than being broken on a routine `swift package update`. Migration: add `case .ended` (run end-of-playback handling) wherever you previously treated `.idle` as end-of-media, and keep `.idle` for pre-load / stopped.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/4.0.0))

## [3.13.4] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **DTS-HD Master Audio failed to bridge ("Residual encoded channels are present without core", #64).** When the audio bridge decoded a DTS-HD MA / HRA track (common on Blu-ray remuxes), the libavcodec `dca` decoder rejected many frames with `EINVAL` because their lossless XLL extension uses residual coding that cannot reconstruct standalone, so the bridge produced no audio for those frames. The bridge re-encodes to lossy EAC3 (or FLAC) and discards the XLL refinement anyway, so it now decodes the mandatory DTS core only (`core_only`), which reconstructs full-rate 5.1/7.1 PCM on every frame. No effect on plain DTS core streams.
- **UDF reader follows allocation-extent continuations (tag 258).** A file whose allocation descriptors overflow its (E)FE chains the rest through an Allocation Extent Descriptor (extent type 3). The reader now follows that chain (depth-bounded) instead of treating the continuation pointer as a bogus data extent. Defensive: inline descriptors already cover ~114 GiB per file, so no current Blu-ray needs it, but a heavily fragmented title would otherwise under-resolve.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.13.4))

## [3.13.3] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **Music Now Playing crashed on tvOS 26 with embedded cover art.** The bare-AVPlayer audio Now Playing path crashed on tvOS 26 (`dispatch_assert_queue_fail`) when a track carried embedded artwork: the system harvested and decoded the asset's embedded cover off the expected queue, and a non-Sendable artwork closure ran off its actor. The engine now follows Apple's recommended path, an auto-publishing `MPNowPlayingSession` with per-item `AVPlayerItem.nowPlayingInfo` instead of manual `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` writes or `externalMetadata`, with writes gated on item readiness to avoid the serial-queue crash during item swaps, and the audio is wrapped in a metadata-free composition so the system never decodes the asset's (sometimes corrupt) embedded artwork.
- **Blu-ray ISO playback failed for every real UDF 2.50 disc image (#62).** The UDF reader found the volume anchor and parsed the volume structure, but listing the root directory returned nothing, so no `BDMV` was found, `DiscReader.wrap` returned `nil`, and the raw image fell through to a plain FFmpeg open that reports `AVERROR_INVALIDDATA`. The cause was a partition-reference bug: a metadata-resident file entry's `short_ad` allocation descriptors were resolved against the physical partition. A `short_ad` carries no partition reference, so it is relative to the file entry's own recording partition; for a metadata-partition entry that means metadata-virtual blocks resolved through the Metadata File. The root directory data lives in the metadata partition, so the wrong sectors were read. `short_ad` now resolves against the file entry's own partition (`long_ad`, which carries an explicit reference for the physical m2ts payload, was already correct). Verified end to end against the Blender Sintel Blu-ray ISO.
- **Audio bridge pipeline diagnostics label ordered as "source -> bridge"** so the logged stage order reads correctly.

### Changed

- **The video decoder frame-handler contract is now `@Sendable`,** hardening the off-actor decode callback for Swift 6 strict concurrency.
- **Bumped FFmpegBuild to 1.0.1 (FFmpeg n8.1.2).**

### Added

- **`AetherEngine.inspectDisc(url:)` plus `aetherctl disc-inspect [--dump]`.** An FFmpeg-free, stage-by-stage walk of a local disc image (ISO9660/UDF signatures, UDF root and BDMV tree, parsed `.mpls` playlists, selected main title, resolved m2ts extents) that reports exactly where recognition bails. `DiscReader` also emits gated `[disc]` diagnostics on the playback path so a future failure is debuggable instead of a silent `nil`.

### Documentation

- **Live MPEG-TS sliding-window and DVR rewind marked device-confirmed** in the formats documentation.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.13.3))

## [3.13.2] — 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **Adversarial bug-audit pass: roughly a dozen correctness, concurrency, and memory-safety fixes across the engine.** The demuxer now synchronizes its `AVIOReader` close flags to close a persistent-connection teardown race, the audio bridge serializes its mutators under an internal lock, drains the decoder at EOF so the final tail is not dropped, and frees partial encoded packets when a FIFO drain throws. The native subtitle cue store is now guarded against the pump thread, SMB `cancel()` unblocks a parked read instead of waiting out the timeout, live seek finalize is guarded on the load generation to drop superseded seeks, and `FrameExtractor` flushes its decoder at EOF so last-GOP snapshots are not lost.
- **Disc reader hardened against untrusted and cancelled reads.** `DiscReader.readAll` now caps untrusted UDF extent allocation, `ConcatIOReader.cancel()` forwards to the base reader, and the sidecar subtitle path avoids a double-free of its `AVFormatContext` when an HTTP open fails. The DVR feeder also seeds at a real keyframe when the seek target precedes the ring.

### Performance

- **O(log n) `segmentIndex` lookup.** The per-packet segment-index resolution now uses a binary search instead of an O(n) linear scan over stored segments.

### Changed

- **Internal quality pass.** Strict-concurrency and deprecation warnings cleared (27 in total), dead code and redundant comments pruned, FragmentSplitter and SegmentCache index math covered by new tests, and the dual-subtitle API plus `dualsubs` CLI documented.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.13.2))

## [3.13.1] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Embedded ASS subtitle feed fell behind playback on packet-dense tracks (#56).** The embedded subtitle side reader published each decoded event through its own awaited `MainActor.run` hop. On a track that stacks many events on the same (or nearly the same) timestamp, those per-event hops serialize the demux loop against the host's on-MainActor ASS renderer, so demux throughput collapses to the MainActor scheduling rate and the published `subtitleCues` fall far behind the playhead (in the reported sample, 1534 ASS events share a single 5.207 s timestamp). Decoded events are now coalesced and flushed to the MainActor in a single hop once the batch spans a short window of source time (sparse tracks still flush per event, so there is no added latency) or reaches a count cap (the decisive throttle for a same-timestamp burst, turning that 1534-event cluster into roughly a dozen hops instead of 1534). The native `tx3g` reader (3.13.0) already wrote cues off-actor and is unaffected.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.13.1))

## [3.13.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Native subtitle tracks for Picture-in-Picture, AirPlay, and external display (#55).** All embedded and sidecar text subtitle tracks can be muxed into the fragmented-MP4 stream as native language-tagged `tx3g` (mov_text) tracks, so AVPlayer renders them itself and they survive PiP, AirPlay, and external-display playback, where a host-drawn overlay is never composited. AVPlayer's stock legible menu enumerates every language for selection. This rides the existing `media.m3u8` path with no master playlist, so SDR / HDR10 / HLG / Dolby Vision (including Profile 5) routing is byte-identical to before. Opt-in via `LoadOptions.prepareNativeSubtitles`; tracks are exposed as `nativeSubtitleTracks` with `setNativeSubtitleSelected(track:)`.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.13.0))

## [3.12.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added

- **`clock.bufferedPosition` for buffer-bar indicators (#54).** A new published value on `engine.clock` reports how far ahead the engine has buffered, on the same source axis as `sourceTime`, so a host can draw a YouTube-style buffer bar as `bufferedPosition / duration`. On the native AVPlayer path it is the end of the contiguous `loadedTimeRanges` span covering the playhead, folded with the same seam shift as `sourceTime`; on the software (dav1d / libavcodec) path it is the newest demuxed source PTS, i.e. how far ahead bytes have been fetched and demuxed from the (possibly remote) source; the audio path mirrors `currentTime`. Clamped to never trail the rendered frame, reset on load / stop. Additive, no behavior change to existing surfaces.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.12.0))

## [3.11.7] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Malformed Dolby Vision "Profile 8.6" rejected by AVPlayer (#53).** Some HEVC sources are tagged DV Profile 8 with an invalid `dv_bl_signal_compatibility_id` (typically 6, which is really P7's marker) because an old tool confused the profile with the `dvhe08.06` level field. The bitstream is a single-layer HDR10-base P8.1 stream, but a `dvvC` whose compat id contradicts the `db1p` brand makes AVPlayer reject the variant outright; previously the engine classified it as P8.1 yet stream-copied the source `dvcC` unmodified, so the invalid compat survived into `init.mp4`. On a DV-capable panel the engine now normalizes the container `dvcC` to a valid P8.1 (compat = 1, profile = 8, el_present = 0) so the `dvvC` and `db1p` supplemental agree and AVPlayer accepts it; no per-packet RPU work is needed since the elementary stream is already P8.1. On a non-DV panel the existing strip path still forces the HDR10 fallback, matching the server's DOVIInvalid remux. Internally this decoupled the container `dvcC` rewrite (`rewriteDoviConfigTo81`) from the P7 per-packet RPU conversion so both routes share the container fix.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.11.7))

## [3.11.6] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Still-image / scrub-preview thumbnails of anamorphic SD content rendered horizontally stretched (#23).** `FrameExtractor` (the on-device frame source for scrub previews and chapter thumbnails) scaled each decoded frame using its coded width and height only, ignoring the sample aspect ratio, so an NTSC DVD (720x480 stored, displayed at 4:3) produced a 3:2 thumbnail. `FrameDecodeContext` now reads the stream SAR at open (per-frame SAR as a fallback, since the software decoder does not reliably attach it) and folds it into the output height via `displayDimensions(...)`, so thumbnails keep the source display aspect (4:3 here, 16:9 for anamorphic widescreen DVDs). Mirrors the main decode-path SAR fix (3.11.3). The HDR tone-map thumbnail path is unchanged (anamorphic content is effectively always SDR). Regression test covers NTSC, PAL, and anamorphic ratios.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.11.6))

## [3.11.5] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Long delay to first subtitle cue when a track is activated mid-playback (no pause) on a slow/remote source (#52).** `selectSubtitleTrack(index:)` mid-playback on a large/remote (high-latency) source showed the first on-screen cue tens of seconds late instead of the ~1-2s the API promises. The side demuxer captured the playhead (`startAt`) before `demuxer.open` and the `duration*0.5` prewarm seek; on a slow source those steps cost several seconds of wall-clock during which unpaused playback advanced, so the reader then seeked to a now-stale position behind the live playhead and paged forward over already-played content. Those cues arrived behind the playhead and were dropped by the current-cue lookup until the read caught up. The reader now re-samples the live playhead after the open + prewarm and re-targets the single existing seek to it (no extra network seek), keeping the bitmap SETUP lead-in and seeding the read-ahead snapshot from the re-sampled value. It is a no-op when paused, on a fast/local open, and on the seek re-arm path.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.11.5))

## [3.11.4] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Spurious terminal `.failed` published while the AVPlayer kept playing (#50).** On engine-native loopback-HLS playback the engine could publish a terminal failure while the player was demonstrably still advancing (clock and subtitle cues moving, segments flowing, title playing to the end), aborting a session that had self-healed. AVPlayer flips `item.status` to `.failed` on transient errors it then recovers from (an in-range loopback 404, or an AVIOReader range-read reconnect), and the `.failed` KVO is not synchronized with the `timeControlStatus` KVO, so the earlier gate (3.11.3) that checked the instantaneous transport state at the failure instant still let a transient through whenever it fired during a brief `.waitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate` blip. The failure publish now discriminates on whether playback was ever established (a latch set on the first `.playing` transition) instead of an instantaneous sample: before playback establishes a `.failed` surfaces promptly (genuine startup failure), and after it every `.failed` is deferred and only surfaced if, after a settle, the player is both stopped and has not advanced its clock. No transient that keeps the clock moving can publish a terminal failure anymore.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.11.4))

## [3.11.3] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Anamorphic SD content (DVD rips, widescreen DVDs) rendered "flattened" / horizontally squished (#23).** DVD MPEG-2 stores non-square pixels (NTSC 720x480 is encoded for 4:3 display; widescreen DVDs for 16:9), but `SoftwareVideoDecoder` attached only color-space metadata to its output `CVPixelBuffer`, never the sample aspect ratio. `CMVideoFormatDescriptionCreateForImageBuffer` therefore produced a format description with no `PixelAspectRatio` extension, and `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` sized the picture with square pixels (a too-wide 3:2). The decoder now captures the container SAR at `open()` and attaches each frame's `sample_aspect_ratio` (with that stream-level fallback) as `kCVImageBufferPixelAspectRatioKey`, so the picture displays at its intended aspect. The native VideoToolbox path already reads SAR from the container, so only the software path needed this.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.11.3))

## [3.11.2] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Interlaced MPEG-2 / VC-1 / MPEG-4 (DVD rips, SD broadcast) played at half speed and froze on resume (#23).** `bwdif` / `yadif` configure their output link with `time_base = input / 2` and emit frame PTS in that halved base, but `DeinterlaceFilter.pull` handed those frames straight to `SoftwareVideoDecoder.emit`, which timestamps every frame on the stream time_base. Reading a doubled-tick PTS with the un-halved base placed every interlaced frame at 2x its real presentation time: from start the video paced at half rate (renderer queue fills, demux parks on back-pressure, audio drains then goes silent); on resume frames landed far in the future so the picture froze on one frame while the audio-driven clock advanced. `pull` now rescales the pulled PTS and duration from the buffersink time_base back into the stream time_base via `av_buffersink_get_time_base`, which also handles the `pts_multiplier = 1` fallback when `av_reduce` cannot form the exact half base.

### Changed

- Loopback-HLS request arrivals are now logged at `.info` (was `.debug`) to surface the request path during the #50 plain-playback 404 investigation.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.11.2))

## [3.11.1] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **System-wide `mediaserverd` wedge after a long background suspension.** A paused native session left running into a multi-hour tvOS suspension kept its AVPlayer decode session, the in-process loopback HLS server sockets, and the upstream AVIO connection all allocated. On resume that wedged the shared `mediaserverd` system-wide: every app (including unrelated ones) could only paint the first frame until the device was rebooted. The `didEnterBackground` handler now tears the video pipeline down instead of merely pausing, releasing the decode session synchronously before suspension. The native host shell and `currentAVPlayer` are kept so Now-Playing survives, and the clock / loaded URL / options are preserved so the host's foreground `reloadAtCurrentPosition()` resumes at the paused position.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.11.1))

## [3.11.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Live Dolby Vision Profile 7 to 8.1 conversion.** P7 sources (dual-layer BL+EL+RPU, the common Blu-ray remux profile that Apple platforms cannot decode) now play by routing the base layer as 8.1 and rewriting the RPU live via `DoviRpuConverter` (libdovi, shipped as the new `LibDovi` xcframework). On any conversion failure the path falls back to HDR10 rather than rejecting the file. The conversion is gated off for SSAI re-init. `aetherctl dovitest <file>` exercises the converter. (S1483, S1484, S1489)
- **P8.2 / P10.2 / P9 base-layer playback.** These profiles now play their base layers instead of being rejected outright.
- **Intel Mac support.** `LibDovi` ships x86_64 fat binaries (macOS and iOS Simulator) as of 1.0.2, so AetherEngine cross-builds for x86_64. (1.0.1 added the iOS slices that 1.0.0 was missing.)

### Fixed

- **Loopback-HLS 404 `loadFailed` wedge after a rapid seek burst (#50).** An in-range VOD segment (`index < segmentCount`) evicted from the rolling window while the single producer sat elsewhere was answered with a 404, which AVPlayer treats as terminal `loadFailed`. The server now returns a retriable 503 for in-range misses (404 stays for genuinely out-of-range indices), and `serveSegment` re-asserts the producer reposition across bounded waits instead of orphaning it behind the #35 restart coalescer's single pending slot.
- **Subtitles raced ahead of the picture during post-seek rebuffer (#49).** Under a sustained seek rate the published clock held the optimistic seek target while AVPlayer stayed parked at the pre-seek frame, so subtitles (which read `sourceTime`) led the on-screen image. `sourceTime` now tracks the actually-rendered frame on the native path while `currentTime` keeps scrub intent. Adds the `clockLeadSeconds` diagnostic.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.11.0))

## [3.10.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- **`preserveASSMarkup` now covers external ASS sidecars.** `selectSidecarSubtitle(url:)` honours the session's `LoadOptions.preserveASSMarkup` for `.ass` / `.ssa` files exactly like embedded tracks: cues carry the raw libavcodec event line (override tags and style references intact) instead of stripped plain text, and the script header (`[Script Info]` + `[V4+ Styles]`) extracted from the file's subtitle-stream extradata is surfaced on the new published `engine.sidecarASSHeader`. Hosts pair the two through `ASSScriptBuilder` to drive a whole-script renderer (swift-ass-renderer's `loadTrack(content:)`) for external subtitles, not just embedded ones. SRT / VTT sidecars and the text-only secondary channel are unaffected (no ASS payload, header stays nil). `SubtitleRectText.rawASSLine(for:)` is now the shared raw-line extractor behind both the inline and sidecar decoders (AetherEngine#48).

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.10.0))

## [3.9.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Independent secondary subtitle track (dual subtitles).** A second, fully independent subtitle channel now runs alongside the primary one, so a host can display two subtitle lines at once (for example the original language plus a translation, for bilingual playback and language learning). The public API mirrors the primary surface: `selectSecondarySubtitleTrack(index:)`, `selectSecondarySidecarSubtitle(url:httpHeaders:)`, `clearSecondarySubtitle()`, plus the published `secondarySubtitleCues`, `isSecondarySubtitleActive`, and `isLoadingSecondarySubtitles`. Internally a `SubtitleChannel` enum threads through the reader, apply, and cancel paths (the primary path stays behavior-identical), each channel owning its own side demuxer, seek re-arm, teardown, and audio-track-reload resume. The secondary channel is text-only (bitmap codecs are rejected) and always decodes to plain text: it never preserves ASS markup, so it stays clean even when the primary is a styled ASS track. `aetherctl dualsubs <file> --primary <i> --secondary <j>` validates the two channels emitting cues independently (AetherEngine#47).

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.9.0))

## [3.8.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- **SMB2/3 playback via the optional `AetherEngineSMB` product.** Play media off an SMB share through the normal decode path, no server-side mount: `SMBConnection` (backed by AMSMB2 / libsmb2, LGPL-2.1, the same license tier as the bundled FFmpeg) is a read-only `ByteRangeSource`, and `SMBIOReader` adapts it to the engine's existing `IOReader`, bridging each synchronous demux-thread read to AMSMB2's async API. Seekable, so audio-track switching, background reload, embedded subtitles, and scrub previews all work. The SMB dependency is scoped to the new product, so the core engine and its tvOS hosts never link libsmb2. Read-only, NTLMv2 / guest auth; on tvOS the host supplies the local-network entitlement. `aetherctl smbtest <smb-url>` validates a share from macOS (AetherEngine#46).

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.8.0))

## [3.7.0] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **Seek on the native loopback-HLS path no longer bounces back through the pre-seek position.** A seek wrote the target clock optimistically and flipped state back to `.playing` without waiting for AVPlayer's seek to physically land, so the 100 ms periodic time observer kept publishing the stale pre-seek clock until the (seconds-late) loopback seek completed — the reported time read the target, snapped back to the old position, then re-settled. `seek(to:)` now awaits the real AVPlayer completion, and the native host suppresses the periodic observer's stale reads while a seek is in flight, so the clock holds the target across the landing (AetherEngine#37).
- **Hang on MKV sources with a missing or out-of-bounds Cues index.** When a file's Cues seek index is absent or points past EOF (truncated / mis-muxed remux), libavformat's matroska seek degrades the VOD cue-prewarm into a multi-GB linear forward scan — tens of minutes (a de-facto hang) on a large remote source, even though every byte range of the stream serves fine. The prewarm seek is now bounded by a deadline (`HLSVideoEngine.cuePrewarmTimeout`); on timeout it falls back to the existing keyframe / uniform-stride segment plan so playback starts promptly. Healthy files (Cues resolve in well under a second) are unaffected.
- **Playback above 2x no longer goes abnormal.** AVPlayer's HLS fast-forward is undefined above 2x for video (an audio-only session plays cleanly to 3x); driving a higher rate sent both audio and video abnormal. `setRate(_:)` now clamps the requested rate to the path's ceiling, and the new `AetherEngine.maxSupportedRate` exposes it (2.0 for video, 3.0 for audio-only) so a host can size its speed picker correctly (AetherEngine#39).

### Added

- **`isSeeking` / `seekTarget` published seek signal.** `AetherEngine.isSeeking` is true from seek entry until the seek physically lands (not the optimistic `.playing` flip), uniform across programmatic `seek(to:)` and native AVKit transport-bar scrubs (which drive a producer restart out of the served window). `seekTarget` carries the in-flight destination on the source-PTS axis. A host coordinating playback across devices can gate on these to tell a deliberate seek from a rebuffer or underflow skip without inferring it from `currentTime` jumps (AetherEngine#38).

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.7.0))

## [3.6.1] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Live no-cut stall classified by read rate, not packet count.** A slow live source that trickles packets (a Wowza SMIL `bounce` re-buffering at an SSAI ad splice) could accumulate enough packets over a long stall to be misread as a cutter wedge, tripping the tight wedge timeout and forcing a premature host retune to the server transcode route mid-program. The watchdog now classifies wedge vs. source starvation by the packet read RATE over the stall window: a genuine wedge streams at full rate but cannot cut, a trickle stays well under the threshold and takes the longer starvation backstop, giving the source time to resume.

### Changed

- The no-cut stall trace now reports a per-window breakdown (video / keyframe / audio / foreign-stream packet counts, last foreign stream index, and the video PTS advance across the stall) so an undetected live boundary is diagnosable from one log line. Non-audio/video streams are also named by codec in the demuxer open log.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.6.1))

## [3.6.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **SSAI ad-pod direct play for FAST channels.** Server-side-ad-inserted live streams (Pluto and similar) now play their ad pods through the direct path instead of falling back to a server transcode. The producer detects a program switch when an ad creative arrives on a different video PID, parses the ad's SPS/PPS by hand to build a fresh codec config (`H264SPS`), rotates the fMP4 muxer, and emits a versioned `#EXT-X-MAP` per discontinuity so AVPlayer resyncs cleanly across the init and resolution change. A no-cut stall watchdog stays underneath as a safety net, escalating a genuinely wedged pod to a host retune.
- **AES-128 clear-key direct play.** Live HLS streams encrypted with full-segment `METHOD=AES-128` (clear-key, the standard FAST-channel scheme) now direct-play: the playlist's `EXT-X-KEY` is parsed, the key fetched and memoised, and each segment decrypted (AES-128-CBC / PKCS7) before demux. SAMPLE-AES and keyless variants still fall back. This is standard HLS, not FairPlay / Widevine.

### Fixed

- **SSAI ad-pod audio sync.** Audio across an ad pod is re-anchored to the video timeline at every creative boundary so it cannot accumulate drift, and an output-timestamp sanitizer at the muxer keeps the stream monotonic across the splice. The final case: amux ad creatives that mux audio on a different source clock than video (audio near 2^33, video from 0) had their audio launched far into the future by copying the video shift verbatim; the audio shift is now derived from each stream's own boundary timestamp against the shared seam, so it stays sample-exact for any source base.
- **Transient slow live segment no longer tears down the session.** A single slow CDN segment used to trip the no-cut watchdog and escalate to a host retune as if the pipeline had wedged. The watchdog now distinguishes a cutter wedge (reading fast, cannot cut) from source starvation (barely reading) and gives a slow segment a backstop that sits past the ingest reader's own retry budget, so it recovers and keeps playing.

### Changed

- High-frequency live trace (per-request local-server lines, per-segment captures) now logs at OSLog `.debug` level and is not mirrored to the host log handler, keeping the default Console stream and in-app log buffers focused on decision and error lines. Retrieve the trace on demand with `log stream --level debug`.
- A successful SDR rate-only display switch (Match Frame Rate engaging on a 50/60 fps stream) no longer logs a misleading "panel stayed SDR despite HDR criteria" warning; the warning is now reserved for genuine HDR handshake failures.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.6.0))

## [3.5.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **DVD-Video ISO playback (decrypted images).** Plays decrypted DVD `.iso` files by reading the ISO9660 bridge filesystem (`ISO9660Reader`), selecting the longest title set by VOB size (`DVDTitleSelector`), and presenting its concatenated VOBs as one synthetic seekable byte source (`ConcatIOReader`) demuxed through the existing MPEG-PS path. Detection (`DiscReader`) routes both `MediaSource.custom` ISO readers and local `.iso` URLs automatically. No decryption (CSS-protected retail discs must be ripped decrypted first), no GPL nav libraries, main title only (no menus / multi-angle). (#36)
- **Blu-ray ISO playback (decrypted images).** Plays decrypted Blu-ray `.iso` files: a read-only UDF 2.50 reader (`UDFReader`, including the metadata partition and fragmented-file allocation descriptors), `.mpls` playlist parsing with longest-title selection (`MPLSParser` / `BDTitleSelector`), and the title's `.m2ts` clips concatenated (`ConcatIOReader`) and demuxed as MPEG-TS through the existing path (H.264 / HEVC / VC-1, AC3 / EAC3 / DTS / TrueHD / LPCM, PGS subtitles). No decryption (AACS retail discs must be ripped decrypted first), no third-party disc libraries, main title only (no menus / BD-J / multi-angle). (#36)
- **MPEG Program Stream and Blu-ray demuxer/codec coverage.** FFmpegBuild (pinned at d7fd54b) now enables the `mpegvideo` and `m4v` raw demuxers, so MPEG-2 / MPEG-4 video inside an MPEG Program Stream (DVD VOB) is identified via the demuxer probe instead of mis-detected as audio, plus the `pcm_bluray` decoder for Blu-ray M2TS LPCM tracks.

### Fixed

- **Rapid-seek wedge on loopback HLS.** A burst of seeks could wedge HEVC loopback playback (clock frozen while the state still reads "playing") through an uncoordinated producer-restart cascade. Restart requests are now coalesced, and an `isBuffering` signal distinguishes a genuine rebuffer from a stall. (#35)

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.5.0))

## [3.4.2] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **EAC3+JOC (Atmos) no longer needlessly bridged on Bluetooth.** EAC3+JOC tracks were force-routed through the FLAC bridge whenever the audio output was Bluetooth A2DP / LE, re-encoding the bitstream and discarding the object metadata. AVPlayer decodes and downmixes EAC3+JOC on Bluetooth natively, so the bridge was unnecessary; a JOC track is signaled in the playlist as `ec-3` (identical to non-JOC EAC3 5.1), which AVPlayer's variant selection accepts on every route. EAC3 now always stream-copies regardless of route: HDMI passes DD+/JOC through, AirPods render Atmos spatially, plain Bluetooth downmixes natively. The only remaining EAC3 bridge case (a source missing the `dec3` extradata the mp4 muxer needs) stays route-independent. Reported and device-verified by DrHurt (#34). ([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.4.2))

## [3.4.1] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **HE-AAC no longer needlessly bridged to EAC3.** HE-AAC (SBR) and HE-AACv2 (PS) audio tracks were unconditionally routed through the audio bridge and re-encoded to EAC3, even from movie containers AVPlayer decodes natively. The forced bridge is now gated on the source lacking an AudioSpecificConfig (live ADTS/MPEG-TS, where a synthesized ASC would mis-signal SBR); a container that ships a valid ASC fMP4 stream-copies and plays natively. Reported by DrHurt (#33). ([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.4.1))

## [3.4.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Demuxed-audio HLS direct play.** Live upstreams whose variants are video-only with a separate `EXT-X-MEDIA` audio playlist (ARD and friends) now direct-play with sound: `HLSLiveIngestReader` spawns a companion rendition reader, a side demuxer opens the audio stream, and the segment producer merges both sources by DTS into one output timeline. Previously these variants failed fast (3.3.0's detection) and forced a server-mediated fallback.
- **Packed-audio renditions.** Audio playlists carrying raw ADTS segments framed by ID3 `PRIV` timestamps (`com.apple.streaming.transportStreamTimestamp`, 90 kHz) are classified per segment and wrapped on the fly (`PackedAudioSegments`), with a synthesized clock aligning them to the video timeline.
- **Live playlist-refresh retry.** Transient refresh failures (CDN hiccups, origin restarts) retry inside a bounded ~12 s budget before the ingest goes terminal, so a single dropped poll no longer kills the session.

### Fixed

- **Live reloads rejoin at the live edge.** An audio-track switch (or any engine reload) on a live session used to re-apply the stale resume position against a server that re-served its full transcode backlog, which could park AVPlayer in `waitingToPlay` forever (device-verified on tvOS 26 + Jellyfin). Reload positioning is now policy-driven (`LiveReloadPolicy`): live rejoins take the playlist's own live-edge join and skip the pre-readiness zero seek; a readiness watchdog (10 s budget from first serving evidence) fails a wedged rejoin cleanly into the host's retune surface instead of hanging.
- **Swallowed play intent on the reused AVPlayer host.** A `play()` issued while `replaceCurrentItem` was mid-swap could be silently dropped, leaving the item `readyToPlay` but parked in `paused`. The host now latches the play intent and re-asserts it at `readyToPlay` (cleared on pause/unload).
- **Published audio index after a live reload.** The engine reconciles the published audio-track selection with what the rebuilt pipeline actually plays, so hosts no longer see a phantom track switch.

### Tooling

- `aetherctl live --reload-test` exercises the live rejoin end to end against the built-in fixture, including the Jellyfin full-backlog replay shape.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.4.0))

## [3.3.1] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

Reliability release: a two-pass full-codebase audit (every file reviewed twice, the second pass adversarially re-verifying the first) fixed ~60 defects and removed ~350 lines of dead code. Highlights:

- **FFmpeg audio-only path actually paces, pauses, and seeks.** A CMSampleBuffer timing bug made every coalesced buffer report its sample count squared as duration, wedging the buffer-ahead gate after one packet (~20 ms audio, then silence); `play()` after `pause()` never resumed the synchronizer; seeks never reset the enqueue high-water mark (backward seek = minutes of silence) and a seek landing in the EOF drain window skipped the track.
- **Resource leaks.** Every demuxer open leaked its 256 KB AVIO buffer (`avio_context_free` does not free `ctx->buffer`); closing a chunked (no-Content-Length) stream leaked the connection, URLSession, and a parked thread; streaming mode gained backpressure so a paused consumer no longer buffers the rest of the file at line rate; `AVChannelLayout` copies are now uninitialized.
- **Teardown and supersession races.** `stop()` no longer blocks behind a producer restart's 5 s wait; a scheduled audio-track switch can no longer resurrect a dismissed session or hijack a newer load; seeks landing mid-stop no longer publish a phantom `.playing`; subtitle track switches no longer let a superseded task overwrite the successor's cues or abort handle.
- **Stale state.** Live TV after an HDR10 film no longer reports `.hdr10` all session; video-to-music switches release the old video AVPlayer; the public `stop()` clears the session identity so background-return hooks can't revive it.
- **Correctness.** Plain-HLG sources now signal `VIDEO-RANGE=HLG` (was PQ) on the H.264 / HEVC routes; live-variant selection no longer reads `AVERAGE-BANDWIDTH` as `BANDWIDTH` (and ignores quoted-value content); 8-channel AAC is no longer declared stereo in the synthesized AudioSpecificConfig; two simultaneous ASS speaker lines with identical timing both survive dedupe; a VT callback force-unwrap crash and several decoder/renderer data races are locked; keep-alive framing on the loopback server survives a segment file changing size mid-response.
- **Diagnostics and tooling.** FFmpeg log dedupe actually works under the custom callback; the packet-leak counter no longer drifts on DV5 sources; `aetherctl` no longer hangs on large `validate` reports, crashes on out-of-range/NaN flag values, or kills the reconnect its own `--drop-after` fixture is testing.

No public API changes (one inert no-op method with no consumers was removed; see release notes).

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.3.1))

## [3.3.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Sidecar subtitles with auth headers.** `selectSidecarSubtitle(url:httpHeaders:)` attaches custom HTTP headers to the subtitle fetch and forwards the session's `LoadOptions.httpHeaders` by default, so subtitles on authenticated hosts (WebDAV and friends) load like the media itself (#32, requested by @bitxeno).
- **Live HLS ingest (`HLSLiveIngestReader`).** Public forward-only `IOReader` that plays a live HLS upstream directly: resolves master playlists (highest-BANDWIDTH variant), polls the media playlist, fetches the MPEG-TS segments sequentially, and feeds them to the demuxer as one continuous TS stream. Phase 1 supports unencrypted TS segments; `EXT-X-KEY` and `EXT-X-MAP` playlists terminate with a typed `HLSIngestError` so hosts can fall back to a server-mediated path. The live-edge join is duration-capped (newest segments covering up to 1.5x the upstream target duration), and the local loopback playlist adapts to the upstream's real cadence: sources whose segments are materially longer than the cut target drop the LL-HLS blocking-reload advertisement and raise `TARGETDURATION` to the arrival cadence, which is what keeps AVPlayer from flagging invalid blocking behavior (-15410) and stalling on bursty upstreams.
- **Live custom sources reach the native loopback.** `Demuxer.open(reader:)` now threads `isLive` into the demuxer options (suppressing the duration-estimate SEEK_END that latched EOF on forward-only readers), and the forward-only-means-software dispatch rule is exempted for live sessions.
- **`aetherctl hlsfixture`.** Local HLS live fixture server (sliding window, master indirection, discontinuity/slow-refresh/404/encrypted/fMP4 fault knobs) with a `--self-test` mode that runs `HLSLiveIngestReader` against it end to end.

### Fixed

- **Live custom-source loss surfaces to the host.** A live custom source whose pump exits no longer enters the URL-reopen backoff (impossible for a synthetic custom URL, it stalled silently after ~23 s of doomed retries); the engine fires the existing `liveSourceReset` retune surface instead.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.3.0))

## [3.2.0] — 2026-06-11

### Breaking

- **Live telemetry moved to `engine.diagnostics`.** The 1 Hz `liveTelemetry` snapshot was the last timer-driven `@Published` on the engine itself: the sampler rewrote it every second of every session (VOD included), so any SwiftUI view observing the engine re-rendered once per second for the whole session, the same render-storm class the 3.0.0 clock split fixed for `currentTime` (#29 follow-up, reported by @ohjey). It now lives on `EngineDiagnostics`, a separate `ObservableObject` mirroring the `PlaybackClock` split. Migration: plain reads (`engine.liveTelemetry`) compile unchanged through a read-only forwarder; Combine/SwiftUI subscriptions move from `engine.$liveTelemetry` to `engine.diagnostics.$liveTelemetry`.

### Added

- **tvOS integration note: SwiftUI `Menu` in custom player chrome.** On tvOS 26 an open SwiftUI `Menu` blinks its focused row whenever any render transaction runs in the hosting tree, even in unrelated leaf views (SwiftUI issue, reported to Apple). README now documents the UIKit-owned menu-button pattern (`UIButton` + `button.menu` in a `UIViewRepresentable` that only replaces the `UIMenu` on real item changes), courtesy of @ohjey (#29).

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.2.0))

## [3.1.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **`engine.fontAttachments`.** Embedded font attachments (TTF / OTF) from the loaded container, exposed as `[FontAttachment]` (filename, MIME type, raw data) so hosts can stage them into a font directory for an ASS renderer. Populated on every `load()`, cleared on `stop()`; survives the in-session audio-switch reload (#30 host contract).
- **`ASSScriptBuilder`.** Reassembles the engine's raw paced ASS event cues (`LoadOptions.preserveASSMarkup`) plus `TrackInfo.assHeader` into a complete ASS script for whole-file renderers such as swift-ass-renderer's `loadTrack(content:)`. Hardened against real-world Matroska tracks: synthesizes the `[Events]` section when CodecPrivate lacks it, strips NUL terminators that make libass stop parsing, and dedupes by event content (start, end, line) because real files hardcode `ReadOrder: 0` on every line.

### Fixed

- **Post-scrub A/V desync and picture jumps on the software path.** The fragmented-MP4 muxer wrote an edit list into `init.mp4` that baked the producer's restart position into `elst`. AVPlayer pins the first `EXT-X-MAP` it sees, so after a backward scrub the stale edit list shifted the presentation timeline: lipsync drifted and the picture jumped. Edit lists are now disabled (`use_editlist=0`); the restart offset travels exclusively via per-track `tfdt`, making `init.mp4` restart-invariant.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.1.0))

## [3.0.1] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Persistent-reader window no longer leaks its backing storage.** The sliding window trimmed consumed bytes with `Data.removeFirst`, which only advances the slice's lower bound: the backing allocation kept growing with every byte ever streamed through the connection (~14 MB/s on an 80 Mbps remux) while the window's logical size held at ~20 MB, until jetsam killed the app on large files. The trim now re-bases the window into fresh compact storage; a 512 MB standalone repro went from +513 MB footprint to +9 MB flat. Same pattern fixed in the sequential streaming reader. Second half of #31 (the first half, subtitle side-demuxer pacing, shipped in 3.0.0).

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.0.1))

## [3.0.0] — 2026-06-10

### Breaking

- **High-frequency playback clock moved to `engine.clock`.** The continuously ticking values (`currentTime`, `sourceTime`, `progress`, `liveEdgeTime`, `seekableLiveRange`, `isAtLiveEdge`, `behindLiveSeconds`) now live on `PlaybackClock`, a separate `ObservableObject`, so the ~10 Hz ticks no longer fire `objectWillChange` on the engine itself. SwiftUI views that observe the engine for track lists / state stop re-rendering per tick; native tvOS `Menu` dropdowns no longer flicker during playback (#29). Migration: plain reads (`engine.currentTime`) compile unchanged through read-only forwarders; Combine subscriptions move from `engine.$currentTime` to `engine.clock.$currentTime` (same for the other clock values).

### Added

- **`probe(source:)`.** The one-shot metadata probe now accepts a `MediaSource`, so custom `IOReader` sources can be probed like URLs. The caller keeps reader ownership; the probe never calls `close()` (#27).
- **`load()` returns `SourceProbe`.** Both `load(url:)` and `load(source:)` return the probe assembled from the internal probe stage (`@discardableResult`, existing callers compile unchanged): video size, codec, duration, tracks, container tags in one shot. `sourceVideoWidth` / `sourceVideoHeight` are also public read-only now (#28).
- **Opt-in raw ASS event lines.** `LoadOptions.preserveASSMarkup` emits ASS / SSA cues as the raw event line (override tags, style references, escapes intact) instead of stripped plain text, and `TrackInfo.assHeader` carries the track's script header (`[Script Info]` + `[V4+ Styles]`) so hosts can render authored styling themselves. Default off; non-ASS codecs unaffected (#30; full libass rendering stays open there).
- **Live DVR scrub thumbnails.** `liveScrubThumbnail` decodes preview stills straight from the DVR segment cache, with an LRU keyed to the live session generation.
- **`DataIOReader`.** A ready-made in-memory `IOReader` over an immutable `Data` buffer, for composed-buffer demuxing and tests.
- **Native remote-HLS path.** `LoadOptions.nativeRemoteHLS` plays a server-provided HLS URL directly with AVPlayer (live edge, buffering, reconnect managed natively), bypassing the demux / remux / loopback pipeline.
- **SW-path deinterlacing.** Interlaced sources route through a persistent bwdif / yadif filter graph on the software decode path.
- **HE-AAC / LATM bridging.** LATM/LOAS AAC live audio bridges instead of dropping; mis-signaled ADTS streams bridge instead of corrupt stream-copy; plain ADTS-AAC stream-copies into fMP4 without the FLAC bridge.

### Fixed

- **Embedded-subtitle side demuxer no longer races to EOF.** It paces against the playhead (90 s read-ahead; TCP backpressure throttles its connection to playback rate). Previously it re-downloaded the entire remaining file alongside playback and pinned every future PGS bitmap cue in memory, which on 50-80 GB UHD remuxes ran the app into jetsam (#31, subtitle part).
- **Live hardening batch.** Server-side stream-replay detection after reconnect (host retune request), program-boundary timeline rebase instead of packet drops, A/V-sync rebase pairing with seam history, source-loss auto-reopen with backoff, deterministic pause/resume, LL-HLS blocking playlist reload for faster startup, fast give-up on dead tuners (hard HTTP errors / never-productive sources), abortable in-flight probes on stop / channel zap.
- **VOD robustness batch.** Muxer-wedge exit, audio-bridge EOF / restart flush, Range-ignored (200-at-offset) guard, cache-gated backward restart, paused-seek clock anchor, corrupt-source-audio resilience in `swr_convert`.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/3.0.0))

## [2.5.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Live TV and DVR (timeshift) playback.** `LoadOptions.isLive` opts a session into unbounded live mode. Pass `dvrWindowSeconds` (e.g. `1800`) to enable in-session timeshift; omit it (nil) for live-only playback where `seek()` is a no-op. The host drives a single scrubber against a session-relative timeline (seconds since first frame) that is identical across both the native and software paths.
- **Native-path live (H.264 / HEVC / AV1-with-HW).** A forward-only live producer cuts segments on the fly and serves a sliding HLS playlist (advancing `#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE`, no `#EXT-X-ENDLIST`, no `#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE`) to AVPlayer. Timeshift uses AVPlayer's native seekable range; discontinuities are signaled via `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` so the session timeline stays monotonic.
- **Software-path live (AV1-without-HW / VP9 / MPEG-2 / VC-1).** Unbounded live with no duration guard. Timeshift is backed by a disk-spooled, keyframe-indexed `PacketRingBuffer` that retains up to `dvrWindowSeconds` of packets; seek within the ring rewinds without a network round-trip. PTS-offset repair keeps the session timeline monotonic across source discontinuities.
- **`LoadOptions.dvrWindowSeconds: Double?`.** Nil (default) enables live-only mode. A non-nil value enables timeshift with that rewind window in seconds; `1800` (30 min) is the suggested starting point for IPTV / broadcaster feeds.
- **`@Published private(set) var liveEdgeTime: Double`.** The current live edge expressed as session-relative seconds since the first frame. Advances continuously during live playback.
- **`@Published private(set) var seekableLiveRange: ClosedRange<Double>?`.** The DVR-seekable span of the session timeline. Nil when DVR is disabled or the session is not live. Hosts can bind a scrubber's range directly to this property.
- **`@Published private(set) var isAtLiveEdge: Bool`.** True when the playhead is within a small threshold of `liveEdgeTime`. Note: this is generally false during normal live playback because it anchors on the buffered live edge; call `seekToLiveEdge()` to snap to live rather than polling this flag.
- **`@Published private(set) var behindLiveSeconds: Double`.** Seconds the current playhead lags behind `liveEdgeTime`. Zero when at the live edge or when DVR is disabled.
- **`func seekToLiveEdge() async`.** Snaps the playhead to the live edge, on both paths. Safe to call at any time during a live session; no-op when live-only.
- **`seek(to:)` extended for DVR.** In a live session with DVR enabled, `seek(to:)` accepts a session-relative position clamped to `seekableLiveRange`. In live-only sessions it remains a no-op, preserving the existing contract for callers that do not opt into DVR.
- **`AVIOReader` endless-feed mode.** The demuxer AVIO no longer synthesizes EOF from a `Content-Length` header in live sessions. Terminal error is reported only after reconnect retries are exhausted, so transient CDN drops don't terminate the session.
- **Stable live `#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION`.** Live playlists declare a generous, stable target duration from the first manifest and hold the initial response until the first segment is ready, so high-bitrate live sources no longer fail at startup with `CoreMediaErrorDomain -12888`.

### Notes

- Live sliding-window memory behavior and `behindLiveSeconds` accuracy were verified off-device (resident-footprint plateau under a sliding playlist, stable behind-live at real-time pacing). On-device confirmation on Apple TV with a real broadcast feed is still recommended.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.5.0))

## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-07

Custom input sources. A new public `IOReader` protocol lets hosts play media from any byte source (memory buffers, encrypted-at-rest archives, proprietary containers) through `load(source: .custom(...))`. No breaking API change, existing `load(url:)` callers are unaffected.

- **`IOReader` + `MediaSource` + `load(source:)`.** Implement `read` / `seek` / `close` and pass an instance via `MediaSource.custom(_:formatHint:)`. `load(url:)` is retained and forwards to the new entry point. Internally the engine attaches the reader to the demuxer's `AVFormatContext.pb`, the same seam the built-in `AVIOReader` uses, so no FFmpeg types are exposed (resolves #26).
- **Both playback paths, video and audio.** Seekable readers play on the native (AVPlayer / HLS-remux) and software decode paths; audio-only custom sources route through the software audio path (AVPlayer is URL-only). Forward-only readers (seek returns negative) play too, auto-routed to the software path.
- **Full mid-playback feature set on capable readers.** Audio-track switching and background reload work for seekable readers (the pipeline rebuilds on the retained reader). Embedded-subtitle selection and scrub-preview thumbnails work for readers that implement the new optional `makeIndependentReader()` (a second independent cursor); they no-op when it returns nil.
- **`cancel()` is now a protocol requirement** (with a default no-op) so a host override dispatches through the `any IOReader` existential. It must only unblock a pending read, never invalidate the reader, since the engine reuses the reader across an internal reload.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.4.0))

## [2.3.0] — 2026-06-06

New public API for media metadata, plus episode-autoplay playback-reliability fixes. No breaking API change, existing 2.x callers are unaffected.

- **`MediaMetadata` extracted on every load.** The demuxer parses normalized container tags (title, artist, album, albumArtist, with whitespace cleanup) and pulls embedded cover art. The engine publishes it at load time and exposes it through `SourceProbe`, and `aetherctl` prints the parsed container metadata in its probe output. Driven by the AetherPlayer media-player work.
- **Episode autoplay no longer starts audio before video.** The native `AVPlayer` reused across native-to-native reloads (since 2.2.1) carried its previous `rate=1.0` into the next item, so the new episode auto-resumed before the display-criteria handshake and played audio while the panel was still mid Match-Frame-Rate switch. The host now pauses the player across the item swap, so the post-handshake `play()` gates the start.
- **No more mid-playback stall plus A/V desync a minute or two into a stream.** `SegmentCache` evicted already-produced forward segments when AVPlayer did a transient backward refetch (an audio handover or decode flush moved the prune target back), which forced a cache-miss producer restart that re-muxed from a fresh init segment. The forward prune bound is now anchored on the highest stored index so produced-but-unconsumed segments survive the dip, and the restart decision no longer treats a resident segment the producer merely raced past as a pruned gap.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.3.0))

## [2.2.2] — 2026-06-06

Playback-clock correctness. The engine now presents a single source-PTS timeline. No breaking API change, existing 2.2.x callers are unaffected.

- **Unified the playback clock onto source PTS.** On the native HLS path `currentTime` previously mirrored AVPlayer's loopback clock (`source_pts - playlistShiftSeconds`) while `sourceTime` carried source PTS, forcing every source-timeline consumer (subtitle scheduling, media-segment intro/outro detection, resume reporting) to pick the right one of two clocks. The shift is now folded into the published `currentTime`, so `currentTime == sourceTime` on every path (the software and audio paths already ran on source time). Resume and `reloadAtCurrentPosition` get slightly more accurate as a result, and on a rare imprecise restart seek the reported position now reflects the true landed frame.
- **`seek(to:)` is now source-PTS based** and converts to the loopback clock internally (a no-op on the software and audio paths, where the shift is 0). A `seek(toSourceTime:)` alias exists but is deprecated, since `seek(to:)` now covers it. `sourceTime` stays public as a stable alias for callers that want to express source-timeline intent explicitly.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.2.2))

## [2.2.1] — 2026-06-06

Playback, audio, and Now-Playing fixes. No public API change, existing 2.2.x callers are unaffected.

- **Persistent forward-streaming AVIO reader for CDN direct-URL playback (#25).** The fragile chunked range reader is replaced with a VLC-style single forward-streaming connection that reconnects with backoff on drops. Waiting on data is now edge-triggered, and the reconnect cap is progress-aware so a stream that keeps advancing is not killed by a transient stall.
- **Multichannel audio no longer downmixes to stereo with continuous-audio off (#24).** Audio-route capability is sampled after playback settles rather than at `readyToPlay`, when the HDMI route has not finished negotiating yet. The native path lets AVKit own audio-session activation, and the manual reassert is scoped to the renderer paths that actually need it. (Earlier session-reassert and route-renegotiation attempts in this cycle were disproven on device and reverted.)
- **System Now-Playing survives native-to-native reloads (#15).** Episode autoplay and audio-track switches reuse the existing native `AVPlayer` via `replaceCurrentItem` instead of building a fresh one, which previously blanked the Control Center Now-Playing card on every swap.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.2.1))

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-05

New public API: an audio-only playback path. `LoadOptions.audioOnly` routes a source into a lean audio pipeline that never builds the HLS loopback server, the display layer, or the video producer. Decode is native-first: codecs on the `avPlayerCanDecodeAudio` whitelist hand the URL straight to a bare `AVPlayer` (`AudioAVPlayerHost`), everything else falls back to an FFmpeg decode into `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` (`AudioPlaybackHost`). The engine branches `load()` into the audio path, routes transport (play / pause / seek) to the active host, and tears the host down in `stopInternal` for a clean handoff back to the video path.

System Now-Playing for the audio path: the AVPlayer host owns a persistent per-player `MPNowPlayingSession` (exposed via `audioNowPlayingSession`) that stays the active Now-Playing app across a background pause, auto-publishes now-playing info from the player, and carries `externalMetadata`. The host survives across tracks (no per-track teardown) and does not pause when the app backgrounds, so audio keeps playing with the system overlay live. All of this is gated `#if os(tvOS) || os(iOS)`; the path builds clean on macOS (no system session there) and iOS as well as tvOS.

New `aetherctl audio` subcommand for audio-path smoke testing: prints the active decoder and final duration, driven under `CFRunLoop` so end-of-track fires at playback end rather than demux EOF.

Minor bump: purely additive public API, no breaking changes. Existing 2.1.x callers compile and run unchanged.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.2.0))

## [2.1.3] — 2026-06-01

Playback fix. Transport state sync. No public API change, existing 2.1.x callers are unaffected.

- **Rapid play/pause presses no longer get swallowed.** On the native (AVPlayer) path the engine never derived its `state` from the player. When something other than `engine.play()` / `pause()` drove the AVPlayer (a host that keeps AVKit's transport bar active for Control Center skip routing, Control Center itself, or the hardware play/pause button AVKit handles internally), the engine's `state` went stale and the next `togglePlayPause()` resolved to the action already in effect, a visible no-op. `NativeAVPlayerHost` now publishes `timeControlStatus` and the engine reconciles `state` (playing / paused) from it, guarded to the steady transport states so loading, seeking, error and idle are never clobbered (`waitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate` maps to playing so the icon does not flicker on a rebuffer). `togglePlayPause()` additionally decides from the live player rather than the published state, closing the async gap during fast presses.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.1.3))

## [2.1.2] — 2026-06-01

Playback fix. Head-of-stream A/V sync. No public API change, existing 2.1.x callers are unaffected.

- **Audio no longer leads video at file start.** On a fresh play (`baseIndex 0`) the producer snapped the first audio packet onto the video's `tfdt` (desired 0), which subtracted the audio track's intrinsic start offset from every audio packet. On sources whose first full audio frame lands well past video frame 0 (Cars: EAC3 first frame at +256 ms) this pulled the whole audio track that far ahead of the picture for the entire session (reported as a 256 ms A/V offset in the stats overlay). Head-of-stream now derives the audio shift from the video's origin shift, so both streams undergo one shared transform and their true source-time relationship is preserved by construction. Resume and scrub sessions were unaffected and keep the existing gate-on-video snap.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.1.2))

## [2.1.1] — 2026-05-31

`FrameExtractor` quality pass. Internal only, no public API change, existing 2.1.0 callers are unaffected.

- **HDR thumbnails tone-map correctly.** PQ (ST 2084) and HLG stills used to render too dark / desaturated because the extractor scaled straight to sRGB with no transfer conversion. HDR frames now route through a zscale + tonemap libavfilter graph (BT.2020 PQ/HLG to SDR BT.709 RGBA, hable tone curve); SDR keeps the direct sws path. Requires the avfilter + zimg FFmpegBuild (already pinned).
- **Faster, lighter remote extraction.** A `.stillExtraction` demuxer profile gives the extractor's AVIO a random-access shape: no read-ahead prefetch (which a scrub discards on the next seek and which competed with playback bandwidth), a 1 MB seek chunk, and a small probe budget. Plus decode fast-flags (skip loop filter, fast decode).
- **Fix: thumbnails on sparse-keyframe HEVC.** The thumbnail decode no longer sets `skip_frame = NONKEY`, which starved the decoder when a seek landed mid-GOP past a lone keyframe (nil thumbnail on some HEVC sources).

Known limitation: DV Profile 5 (IPT-PQ, no HDR10 base) thumbnails still have wrong colours on the software decode path, same class as the AV1 Profile 10.0 limitation. Full P5 playback is unaffected (native AVPlayer path).

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.1.1))

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-31

New public API: `FrameExtractor`, off-playback still-image extraction. Produces `CGImage`s from a media URL through an FFmpeg decode context fully isolated from playback (no contact with the HLS loopback server or shared engine state). Two modes share one decode core: `thumbnail(at:maxWidth:)` snaps to the nearest keyframe and downscales (scrub previews, Recents lists), `snapshot(at:maxSize:)` decodes forward to the exact PTS at full resolution (user stills).

`FrameExtractor` is an `actor`: blocking FFmpeg work runs on a dedicated serial queue off the cooperative pool, the decode context opens lazily, a superseded request cancels the in-flight decode so the latest scrub position wins, results land in a bounded LRU cache (mode-isolated stores, second-bucketed thumbnails), and the context idle-closes after 10 s. `shutdown()` is the explicit permanent teardown that awaits release of the FFmpeg resources.

`AetherEngine.makeFrameExtractor()` vends an extractor for the currently loaded URL (carrying its HTTP headers); arbitrary items construct `FrameExtractor(url:httpHeaders:)` directly. The engine does not retain the returned extractor; the caller owns its lifecycle.

New `aetherctl extract` subcommand for still extraction + leak testing (`--at`, `--snapshot`, `--width`, `--loops`), backed by the same public API.

Minor bump: purely additive public API, no breaking changes. Existing 2.0.x callers compile and run unchanged.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.1.0))

## [2.0.2] — 2026-05-28

Follow-up bugfix to 2.0.1's Profile 5 work. The colr fix in 2.0.1 put the PQ transfer signal on the output sample entry but AVPlayer still failed the asset with `CoreMediaErrorDomain -4` because the source MP4's `hvcC` carried only the 22-byte configuration header (`numOfArrays = 0`) with VPS / SPS / PPS in-band on every IRAP packet. `CMVideoFormatDescription` cannot be built from a `dvh1` sample entry whose configuration record has no parameter set arrays. The matroska demuxer doesn't hit this because matroska parameter sets live in `CodecPrivate`, which FFmpeg lifts into `codecpar.extradata` as a complete annex-B sequence that the mp4 muxer's `ff_isom_write_hvcc` then rebuilds properly.

The fix scans the first IRAP packet for VPS / SPS / PPS NAL units, builds a proper hvcC byte sequence (header + 3 parameter set arrays), and replaces the output stream's `codecpar.extradata` before `avformat_write_header`. Gated on the precise signal: HEVC codec, extradata ≥ 23 B with byte 22 = 0, NALU length size 4.

Verified locally against the issue #19 sample: loopback playback advances in QuickTime / AVPlayer, init.mp4 has all four boxes (`dvh1` + `hvcC` 125 B with parameter sets + `colr nclx 9/16/9` + `dvcC` P5 L6 compat=0), colors render correctly.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.0.2))

## [2.0.1] — 2026-05-28

Bugfix release: Dolby Vision Profile 5 MP4 sources whose SPS VUI omits the transfer characteristic and whose container has no `colr` atom now play correctly. Previously the engine stream-copied the gap through to its output fMP4, so AVPlayer saw a `dvh1` sample entry with no PQ signal and refused to engage the DV decoder. The same content as MKV played fine because matroska's `Colour` element gives FFmpeg explicit `codecpar.color_*` that the mp4 muxer writes as a `colr nclx` atom; the mp4 demuxer has no equivalent fallback.

The fix forces the canonical P5 color tuple (BT.2020 / PQ / BT.2020-NCL / limited range) on the muxer's stream codecpar before `avformat_write_header`. P5 is defined as IPT-PQ-c2, so the `dvcC` record alone implies that signaling, which makes the override safe (no risk of mislabeling a non-PQ source).

Reported by @strangeliu (issue #19), diagnosed with @DrHurt's broken-vs-Dolby-reference framing.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.0.1))

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-27

Stability milestone: the HDR / Dolby Vision routing path is now considered done after the DrHurt #4 sweep across multiple panel modes settled, and the adoption-readiness package (tests, CI, CHANGELOG, examples, Swift Package Index listing) makes the project safe to depend on. **No breaking changes to the public API surface** — existing 1.5.0 callers compile and run unchanged. The major version bump is a stability signal, not an API redesign.

Key user-visible changes since 1.5.0:

- **Match Dynamic Range OFF correctly detected.** tvOS exposes only one combined `isDisplayCriteriaMatchingEnabled` flag for Match Content (rate + range). Users with Match Frame Rate ON and Match Dynamic Range OFF previously had the engine route HDR sources through master playlists with `VIDEO-RANGE=PQ`, which AVPlayer rejected with -11848 / -11868 since the panel stayed in SDR. The engine now reads `UIScreen.currentEDRHeadroom` after the criteria handshake settles and uses that empirical reading for the master-vs-media routing decision.
- **`sourceVideoFormat` published.** Stats / debug overlays can now show "what's in the file" alongside "what the panel is presenting". A DV source on an HDR10-only TV now reads `sourceVideoFormat = .dolbyVision`, `videoFormat = .hdr10`.
- **LiveTelemetry + memory probe restart after audio-track switch.** Diagnostic samplers no longer go silent after the user picks a different audio track mid-session.
- **HLS producer reliability hardening.** Forward-scrub + back-scrub combinations no longer leave AVPlayer stuck waiting for evicted segments. The cache high-water reset moved AFTER the restart returns (was BEFORE, creating restart cascades). Proactive backward-jump restart applied to both `mediaSegmentURL` and `mediaSegment` (data) code paths.

Adoption-readiness additions:

- `Tests/AetherEngineTests/` with 12 unit tests covering pure-function surfaces.
- GitHub Actions CI runs `swift test` on macOS plus `xcodebuild` smoke builds for tvOS and iOS Simulators on every push and PR.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) as an in-repo release index.
- README › Stability and versioning documents the SemVer contract for adopters.
- README › Known limitations spells out the deferred / accepted-loss items so adopters can size them before integration.
- `Examples/MinimalPlayer/MinimalPlayerApp.swift` — a 90-line SwiftUI drop-in app demonstrating the smallest viable AetherEngine integration.
- `.spi.yml` for Swift Package Index multi-platform build matrix.

Internal:

- `resolveCodecRoute` extracted out of `HLSVideoEngine.start()`. The 300-line codec / DV dispatch switch is now a private function returning a `CodecRoute` struct. `start()` drops from ~830 to ~520 lines. Pure refactor, no behaviour change.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.0.0))

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-26

DV detection rewritten to read side-data before `color_trc` so DV Profile
8.4 (HLG base) and Profile 5 (often unspecified base-layer trc) enter the
DV branch. VP8 routed through the SW pipeline alongside VP9. MLP decoder
added to AudioBridge for BD-MV remuxes. New `aetherctl swdecode`
subcommand for reproducing SW-path issues locally. HLS producer restarts
cleanly on far-behind segment fetches. Display criteria preserved across
audio-track switches. EAC3+JOC auto-routes through the FLAC bridge on
Bluetooth A2DP / LE since Atmos passthrough is impossible over those
routes. ([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.5.0))

## [1.4.4] — 2026-05-26

Fixed `AVFoundationErrorDomain -11868` /
`AVErrorNoCompatibleAlternatesForExternalDisplay` on tvOS 26.5 for HDR /
DV sources (SDR was unaffected). Root cause: tvOS 26.5 enforces the
"criteria-before-load" ordering synchronously at HLS variant validation,
which AVKit-auto cannot satisfy for HLS multivariant HDR sources.
Engine-driven sole-writer is the only working pattern; hosts should set
`appliesPreferredDisplayCriteriaAutomatically = false` and pass
`LoadOptions(suppressDisplayCriteria: false)`. DV 8.1 / 8.4 emission
hardened: `hvc1` sample entry + `SUPPLEMENTAL-CODECS=dvh1.../db1p` on DV
panels, strip DV side data on non-DV panels.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.4.4))

## [1.4.2] — 2026-05-26

Live-stream scaffolding (`LoadOptions.isLive`, `@Published var isLive`,
`seek` becomes no-op when live). MPEG-4 Part 2 / MPEG-2 / VC-1 routed
through the SW pipeline. DV 8.1 emission now includes the `/db1p` brand
identifier on `SUPPLEMENTAL-CODECS` so AVPlayer's DV pipeline actually
engages. `DisplayCriteriaController.reset()` no-ops when no `apply()`
happened during the session, preventing nil-write races against AVKit's
in-flight criteria management.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.4.2))

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-25

`waitForSwitch` Stage 1 grace extended from 200 ms to 1000 ms so AVKit's
async criteria write lands inside the gate. `play()` now waits for the
panel handshake to settle (initial load + audio-track-reload paths) so
DV / HDR cold-path first-frame stalls go away in AVKit-sole-writer hosts.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.4.1))

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-25

Added `LiveTelemetry` 1 Hz sampler for host stats overlays. Added
`FFmpegLogBridge` routing `av_log` output through `EngineLog`. Fixed
`waitForSwitch` async-handshake race that surfaced as AVPlayer -11848
"Cannot Open" on DV sources (the previous `isDisplayModeSwitchInProgress`
guard misclassified the setter's async window as "no switch needed").
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.4.0))

## [1.3.2] — 2026-05-23

DV Profile 7 (UHD-BD remuxes) now plays: routed as plain HEVC HDR10 with
the source `dvcC` stripped from the muxer output, so VT's HEVC selection
doesn't reject the sample entry with -12906. Resolved CDN URL cached
across range fetches (debrid / signed-URL proxies were paying the
redirect on every Range request, ~6 ops/sec at 4K HEVC). Engine logging
unified through `EngineLog`.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.3.2))

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-23

Producer's empty-cache restart now fires after far scrubs (previous "wait
for cold-start" assumption stalled AVPlayer for 30 s on back-scrubs after
a forward scrub had moved the producer far away). DV Profile 5 routes
through the master playlist on HDR-ready non-DV panels (DV→HDR10
tonemap), and through the media playlist on SDR-locked panels (where
tvOS 26 rejects bare `dvh1.05` master with -11868). A/V gap reported in
the audio-gate-open log.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.3.1))

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-22

Audio bridge gained two modes: `.surroundCompat` (default, EAC3 per-channel
at 128 kbps, soundbar-compatible) and `.lossless` (FLAC up to 7.1, needs
multichannel-LPCM-capable AVR). `dec3` / `dac3` now built from packet
bitstream via the mp4 muxer's `+delay_moov` flag (no host-side
reconstruction). DV Profile 5 dispatch unified on `dvh1` sample entry +
`dvcC` regardless of panel, routing decides master vs media. Memory leaks
audited: URLSession task pool retention, subtitle cue accumulation,
periodic muxer recycle all root-caused.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.3.0))

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-17

Audio FLAC-bridge gate target rescaled into source TB (the prior
encoder-TB rescale ran 48× too far into source on DTS-HD MA sources,
producing 44 s A/V drift on cold start). MP3 routed through FLAC bridge
(AVPlayer reads any `mp4a` sample entry as AAC and rejects MP3 frames with
-11829). Embedded subtitle PTS origin documentation + matroska NOPTS
repair.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.2.0))

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-16

Three days of Sodalite public-beta feedback drove the A/V sync overhaul:
unconditional `AV_PKT_FLAG_KEY` video gate (initial-start as well as
restart), audio always waits for video gate, per-stream dynamic PTS shift
into the playlist origin, NOPTS dts repair, HEVC open-GOP CRA + leading
RASL B-frame drop. HDR / DV routing now respects the tvOS Match Content
master toggle. SDR rate-only display criteria (Match Frame Rate works
independently of Match Dynamic Range). HDR10+ runtime detection from T.35
SEI. Effective `videoFormat` clamped to panel capability.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.1.0))

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-13

First stable release. Two coexisting playback pipelines (native AVPlayer
via local HLS-fMP4 loopback for HEVC / H.264 / native AV1; SW dav1d / VP9
through `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` for codecs AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 path
rejects). HDR10 / HDR10+ / HLG / Dolby Vision Profile 5 / 8.1 / 8.4
support. Stream-copy passthrough for fMP4-legal audio codecs; AudioBridge
fallback for the rest. Bitmap + text subtitle decoder. LGPL-3.0 with App
Store exception.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.0.0))
