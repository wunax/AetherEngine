"""Validate the relative links and heading anchors in the docs the website publishes.

The docs site (aetherengine-website) runs starlight-links-validator over the rendered
pages and fails the build on a broken anchor. That check lives in a different repo and
only runs AFTER a push to main, so a bad anchor ships first and is discovered second:
`docs/api.md` linked `formats.md#dolby-vision` against a heading that slugs to
`#dolby-vision-signaling`, and the site build failed on every dispatch from 6.58.0 until
it was noticed two releases later.

This is the same check, in this repo, before the merge. It is deliberately not a general
Markdown linter: it validates exactly what a broken link costs someone, on the site and
on GitHub alike.

  - a relative link to a repo file that does not exist
  - an anchor, same-file or cross-file, that no heading produces

Absolute URLs are not fetched; a link checker that reaches the network is a flake source
and would fail on every rate limit and every temporary outage.

Anchors are slugged the way GitHub and Starlight both do it (github-slugger): lowercase,
drop everything that is not a letter, digit, hyphen, underscore or space, then whitespace
runs become single hyphens, with `-1`, `-2` suffixes for repeats. Verified against the two
cross-file anchors this repo already carries.

Usage:  Scripts/check-doc-links.py [--root DIR]
Exit:   0 clean, 1 broken links found (each one printed with file, line and a suggestion).
