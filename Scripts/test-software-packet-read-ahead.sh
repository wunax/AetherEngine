# Pure Foundation concurrency/data test; no macOS/iOS application target is built. The three
# Diagnostics files are the real ones, not stubs: the read-ahead logs its QoS transitions (AE#519),
# and a standalone build that shimmed those would compile a different file from the one it claims to
# cover. Each is self-contained (Foundation / os / Darwin), so the list stays cheap. A new dependency
# in the file under test lands here as a link error, which is the whole point of a separate build.
