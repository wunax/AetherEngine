        // Xcode Cloud) can build without a sibling FFmpegBuild checkout.
        // Pinned to the minor rather than `from:`: this package ships the
        // prebuilt decode stack, so a floating minor silently changes which
        // FFmpeg a released engine tag runs (2.3.0 -> 2.4.0 did exactly that
        // under 5.28.0), and a minor that raises a platform floor retroactively
        // breaks every tag that floats onto it (LibDovi 1.1.0, below). Patch
        // rebuilds still reach existing tags, which is where a pure rebuild
        // belongs; anything that adds slices or enables a component is a minor
        // and reaches consumers through an engine release.
