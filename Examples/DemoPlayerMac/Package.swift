// DemoPlayerMac, standalone macOS demonstrator for AetherEngine.
// Builds against the AetherEngine package via a local path so the
// demonstrator stays in lock-step with the engine source it ships
// alongside. `swift run` from this directory launches the window;
// see README.md for the .dmg packaging path.
