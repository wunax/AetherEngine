// LiveChannelHost.swift
//
// The parts of a live integration that are not a compile error when you get
// them wrong. MinimalPlayerApp shows the smallest viable player; this shows
// what a channel needs on top of it, and every piece here exists because a
// shipping host got it wrong first.
//
// Four contracts, all of them documented in docs/api.md, all of them silent
// when unanswered:
//
//   1. liveSourceReset. The engine parked a session it cannot revive and is
//      asking for a fresh load. Unsubscribed, the channel stops while the
//      engine still reports a session, which from the outside is a freeze.
//   2. The retune needs its own guard. A manual zap path carries none,
//      because a human paces it; driven by the engine it loops on a dead
//      upstream. Spend the bound out loud: a ladder ending on a silent
//      return is the same dead channel with a counter behind it.
//   3. CancellationError out of load() is not a failure. It is what a load
//      throws when a newer load or a stop supersedes it, so every zap
//      produces one, and a host that treats "load threw" as a failure
//      reacts to its own navigation.
//   4. The audio tap is bound to its session and ends with it, including on
//      a session-preserving reload. Re-install on stream end.
//
// Copy the shape, not the numbers. One retune in flight, 20 s apart, three
// per session is what the reference host settles on; your channel budget is
// yours.
