# Contributing to AetherEngine

Thanks for your interest. AetherEngine is the video playback engine behind [Sodalite](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/Sodalite) (tvOS) and [AetherPlayer](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherPlayer) (macOS). Most of the interesting work here is format- and platform-specific, so a good bug report or a focused PR with a clear test plan is worth a lot.

## Reporting bugs and requesting capabilities

Open an issue using one of the [templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). For playback bugs, the source media details (container, video codec and profile, audio codec, HDR / Dolby Vision profile) and any AVPlayer / CoreMedia / VideoToolbox error codes are the single most useful thing you can provide. `ffprobe` output and a sample file make triage dramatically faster.

If the problem is in a host app's UI rather than the engine, report it on that app's tracker instead (the issue chooser links both).

## Building and testing

AetherEngine is a Swift package. It builds for iOS 16+, tvOS 17+, macOS 14+, and visionOS 1+.

```bash
swift build
swift test
```

For iterative work, open `Package.swift` in Xcode 26+ and pick the `AetherEngine` scheme. `FFmpegBuild` is a transitive dependency that supplies the bundled FFmpeg / dav1d binaries; you do not build it yourself.

The `aetherctl` command-line target is macOS-only (it uses `Foundation.Process`) and is excluded from the iOS / tvOS library build.

## Where playback bugs get fixed

A bug that reproduces in a host app but traces back to decoding, demuxing, the audio bridge, or display routing gets fixed **in the engine**, not worked around in the host. If a change starts adding host-side compensation for engine behavior, that is a signal the fix belongs here instead. PRs that move logic in the right direction are very welcome.

## Pull requests

- Keep each PR focused on one change.
- Fill in the test plan: the device, OS, and exact media you tested against. Engine behavior varies by all three, so "tested on Apple TV 4K, tvOS 26, DV Profile 8.1 MKV" tells a reviewer far more than "works for me."
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`, and the documentation in the same commit (see below; three tests enforce parts of this, so a PR that skips it fails rather than merges).
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat(audio):`, `fix(muxer):`, `chore(deps):`, and so on).
- Treat `internal` types and properties as private; they are not part of the public contract and can change in any release.

## Documentation, and the tests that hold it to the code

[docs/api.md](docs/api.md) is the public surface an adopter reads; [docs/formats.md](docs/formats.md) and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) are the depth behind it. Documentation here is not a courtesy pass after the fact: a downstream app once read the whole API tour and came away without a contract that needed a host action, because the tour listed properties and the contract was a `PassthroughSubject` nobody had written a sentence about. Three tests exist so that particular failure cannot repeat quietly, and knowing them beforehand is cheaper than meeting them in CI.

- **`PublicAPIDocumentationTests`.** Every public member of the engine, every host-facing public type and every `LoadOptions` field has to be NAMED somewhere in `README.md` or `docs/`. Naming is a low bar on purpose: the test cannot judge a paragraph, only catch a symbol with no prose anywhere. A symbol that is public for the CLI or the test suite rather than for hosts goes in the test's `notHostAPI` list with its reason.
- **`DocumentedConstantsTests`.** Numbers the documentation quotes ("2 GiB cap", "128 kbps per channel", "the 60 s lead window") are pinned to the constants that own them, and a failure names the sentence to fix. Add a number to the docs, add its pin in the same commit. This is what caught a paragraph claiming a 15 s margin over a window the code clears by 30 s.
- **The `ExampleSources` target.** The samples in `Examples/` are compiled by `swift build`, so one that stops matching the API breaks the build instead of misleading a reader. They are never a product, so nothing reaches a consumer.
- **`Scripts/check-doc-links.py`**, run by the `docs links` CI job and by hand in a second. Every relative link in the published docs has to point at a file that exists, and every `#anchor` at a heading that produces it. The docs site validates the same anchors, but it builds in another repo after the push, so a bad anchor used to ship first and be found second: `formats.md#dolby-vision` against a heading that slugs to `#dolby-vision-signaling` broke the site build for two releases. Note that the site drops each file's leading H1 (Starlight renders the title from frontmatter), so linking a document's own H1 anchor works on GitHub and 404s on the site; the checker holds you to the stricter of the two.

New public API therefore belongs in `docs/api.md` in the commit that adds it, and behaviour a host has to answer (a subject to subscribe to, a state that is terminal, a stream that ends with its session) belongs in that file's contracts section rather than only in a doc comment.

## Releases and host pins

Maintainers cut releases as annotated tags plus a GitHub Release with notes. Host apps pin AetherEngine by commit SHA, so after a change merges the host repos bump their pins to the new commit. You do not need to touch the host repos in your PR.
